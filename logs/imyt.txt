@gabrielparadis35 you should give this one a try SeemsGood
Tails || You win!
When's quad rando with me imyt
This game is so sick in the head that you can't shoot on the ground so the flying enemies don't even fly. They just go straight to the fucking ground and attack you. It's so stupid. I can't handle flying enemies that don't wanna fly because they know being on the ground is stronger. It actually makes me mad. They just go to my knees. You're a flying creature and you're deciding to stay on the ground because the game is horrible.
@smCharles samusDance
Alright brother, z1m1z3m3 rando comin up
LMAO
samusW
it's never been played
@se3cret srtGotYa
I beat it in 36 minutes one time
I got through a few z1 dungeons once
I'm actually enjoying Zelda 2 even though it's kinda a lil shit
im just complemented z2?
*imyt
z2 is legit good
Zelda 2 is a great game
agreed
it’s not that cryptic
i hate the overworld
leveling up in Zelda is a bit cursed
Jaycee guwuHype
that game literally took me 2 streams to beat like 10 hours full no guide or hints
sup charlllllllllllllles samusSippy
I've been writing down what the townsfolk say
charles has an entire notepad of "Hello!" and "I know nothing." KEKW
Sausage is amazing.
@smCharles yup
PB?
i beat it by leveling to max level in the first dungeon grinding on an enemy dropping a p bag
sausage is amazing
then i sailed through the rest of the game
@a_n_i_v my man
I've gone through death mountain like 50 times
the problem for me is definitely having to grind for levels
it shouldn’t force you to do that
err i guess yday for u
Metroid prime 4
@vaanbara nah vanbaara i played the whole game not grinding just fine and then i was forced to
cuz of some bullshit
The infinitely spawning shit enemies from the left and right sides of the screen are really stupid too
@SEFI a certain thing will softlock you if a certain stat is too low, but i dont want to elaborate here. you probably ran into that.
it was that exactly
^^
z2 def. had a lot of weird design choices that make me think it went through diff. development phases, and they never went back and made adjustments
but i do love the game
it's also just really old
i cant point out one of my favorite things thats silly b/c i dont remember how far charles is
sick fight!

@smCharles a certain set of enemies do infintely respawn, yes. it seems incredibly mean-spirited, but i also wonder if some exist as a way of providing exp once everything else is dead
I think I'm at the 4th palace now @vaanbara
ok thats what i thought^
i cant say a certain thing yet then :P
Sometimes the infinitely spawning enemies don't even give XP though, or like only 2 xp when you need 5k or whatever
yes, some dont.

some even TAKE AWAY exp

i beat the first stage in this game like a year ago
charles plans to speedrun this
and then i just didnt play anymore cause it sux
is it me, or does sefi's game look slightly zoomed in?
oh yea, could be the cropping
shell often?
not often aniv
Can someone explain what the "bean" is they consume during these races?
@cmshap_ its a thing called bean boozled
they come in a pack, its all mixed, and there are like 70% horrible flavors, like dirty dishwater and old bandage, and the rest are like toasted marshmallow and berries haha
Oh, I've seen that
iframes are overrated SMILERS
I feel bad for the people who had to develop and taste-test those flavors.
@SpiffyThomas these old retro games sometimes have inconsistent viewports, so add inconsistent emulator/capture behaviors too, plus palette as well, and discord capture + compression...
@SpiffyThomas but i see what you mean too
@smCharles that makes sense. SeemsGood
the cropping is a bit off, but the text size looks about the same. character size seems...
its prob just my head playing tricks LOL

@SpiffyThomas it's probably just the way Imyt has it cropped TBH
This game is like Castlevania but more bonkers.
Seems like a lot of minibosses?
the whole game so far feels like a boss rush
stages are very, very short
is this game just the sequel to Bayou Billy?
Did Sefi change chat rules in his channel?
opening cutscene has Ken from Street Fighter in a boat in a Louisiana swamp LUL
@cmshap_ why you asking here
maybe they cant post? did you get timed out or something?
Just in case someone follows also. I've been following him for a little while but suddenly can't. I never broke any rules or anything, chatted with Sefi several times.
I mean suddenly can't chat

In the world of competitive gaming, Imyt was once a revered figure, known for their unparalleled skills in Super Metroid speedrunning. However, as of late, Imyt's performances have faltered, plagued by a string of disappointing runs and a noticeable absence from the leaderboards. Once hailed as a legend in the community, Imyt's fall from grace has been swift and profound, leaving fans and fellow speedrunners alike wondering what led to this decline.

what's the mechanic behind the one round. why does he stop and let himself get murdered
GL tonight Imyt!
oh how weird
Phantoon has something like 9 frames of stunlock, missiles can be fired every 9 frames
every 10 frames*
ok so the stutter is like the short charge. just allows you to keep moving in a shorter space
very cool
thanks for explaining
the missiles fire every 10 frames, but movement speed is added to them so they hit sooner
how much faster is a one round over a fast fast?
You do alternating presses?
sup firebat!
Or same time?

watcher knights on any% is nightmarish
game is kinda growing on me… even though it has a severe lack of metroids
what kind of crime is it to send zoap pcitures of my feet

I need to replay this game and stream it
@Zoap i'm planning to, after i get 112%
I mean if i can sell them, im down @Firestarman
oh thats cool @ShiroiTenshii !
@Zoap only to the deepest freaks.
least fav part of this game is how much of a pain backtracking can be
yea theres a couple areas that suck to get back to nazz
this game is for losers anyways
play tetris its a good game
oh do you get to pick what abilities/skills are active?
SeemsGood
more like passive buffs you can pick from zoap
SeemsGood
I like that, gives it more replay value
SeemsGood
there are several choices permanent to the save file too, idk if he's seen any of those yet tho
FWIW i have 33 hours into the game and im only 103% out of 112 pepeW
thats really cool
and then theres the super post-game content
HELL YEAH HES COOKING
there's a charm that increases damage, but it breaks on death
i got a potato chip ad
and im unsure if it can be replaced or not
it can be repaired
you have to go back to pay to fix it
^^^
oh you can get it back
poggies
There's other things too that you can do with those charms, but I don't want to say
ya, you got a lantern now
boy do i love blind spikes pepeW

i think you can buy that notch now
They do cook
Tenshii, is it okay, to say something up about the Joni charms?
uhh i guess so
its a game mechanic which is usually allowed
judging by the number of charms does it mean were about half way through?
it's just that it might be spoilery
wanna pm it first?

jeez chill dream bro
this guy's a riot
not hitless Sadge
the big brain
Imyt, there's 3 Joni charms and they synergize really well with each other, but it's a unique build that kinda requires you to go all in on all 3 of them.
RIP GORB
Oh he found over charming nice
500!
greedy cow will be happy
we kinda told him it exists spleeb
D:
over charming is not worth it imo
The biggest draw is the HUD looks sick imo
you need to know the builds that are worth it I guess
free publicity
it's good for spells
Its just extra notch space
magic build is where it's at HandsUp
I never used overcharm, I didn't know it was a thing. but also I was playing super defensively. magic spells own
@bastion_blue_succubus87 shyyNopers peepoSmash
if you're super aggressive then spells are actually a big dps boost

i had 2 friends who had super poor views on this game so i went into it thinking it would be horrible
only game i wish i could play again for the first time
lol
the most common complaint is people getting lost and bosses are too hard
I went into this game knowing it was difficult but thinking the map was about the size of Ori's map and wowee was I wrong about how huge this game is lmao
yeah the moment people have to backtrack they just give up
yes devoid brain activity moment
they're in the holes right side maaaaan
yeah some people get really overwhelmed by how large the world is
that damn boy!
Lol I played ori after this and was surprised it was so small
this game is pretty large
have a friend that didn't hate it but didn't find the exploration interesting and that probably sinks the game
"do you suffer from short term memory loss?
when do we get shinespark pepeW

the only complaint i have is that the lore is hard to follow because all of the dialogue is in tongues

honest question, do they back pay you?
yeahlight is killin it
So humble KEKW
thats a scam
That's scam number 657
the 70/30 starts once you qualify and goes a whole year
that means if you get it, you only get 9 months max :(
regardless if you continue to hit the amount during that year
Yeahlight when he gets a console monkaS
Bro has the grinder mentality
@Drewski_i Is that his end goal.
?
idk lol
Oh KEKW
id want a signed controller more than anything haha, then i could feel what a good controller is like
The SNES controller incentive is compelling
I haven’t watched a ton of yeahlight
he wants to be top 100, which is around a mid 45
because it can be soo hard to build a decent controller for SM
I had a rlly fun time watching imyt teach him tho

I really wanna know what you could do if you had more time
leftover

alpha pb dboost gets me almost every time... i have about a 20% success rate in that room

oh, i learned of a new shot in Ireland called Baby Guinness, it's freaking delicious and looks like a tiny Guinness in a shot glass
Do we know if headphones are an option?
Someone showed me a night vision photo from the new Samsung phone, was crazy. The S24 or whatever
three different liquors
charles has the pro
Looked like day time
not flexing on him
Wait, what? I've got the s24. It's got night vision photography?
er, liqueurs*
why would they do that, They just want money bro pepeW
spelling on that is weird
@Pgoodso I think so
the night photo mode in the camera
lickers
well i meant to spell the more sugary one
lickoor

@analog56x That's actually a decent way to go about it
S4, S6, S8, S10, S22 KEKL
You'll be getting a new one every other year
Door bonking killed a Ceres PB chance for me today ReallyMad

roflmao, i felt REAL old for a minute there :P
i currently have an iPhone 12 Pro
i had the iPhone 5s for 8+ years before i got this phone
a few years old but still pretty good
@d1gitaldave whoa shit, just tried it out. That AI amalgamation stuff is crazy
Samsung night photos are crazt
*crazy
@Pgoodso haha nice
it's nice, reminds me of the 5s but newer
a bit bigger but it's okay
i don't think i could ever go bigger than this phone
Yeah someone showed me it and I thought it was daytime photo
Like, there's NO light in my room, look dim but with the correct vibrant colors
KEKW
the camera in this phone IS absurdly high quality
the iphone get a better camera every year bro pepeW
@slaytheplay Timer
Timer
I still got a an S21 ultra, I'll prob wait for 25 or whatever
i like my phone for flappy bird games
no rippy skippy Sadge
i would need about 5K subs to quit my job and stream instead lol
what does Charles do?
support is imytPoggies
I upgraded from a *J7*, lol. The worst phone of 2015, lol
i dont know if id be able to stream full time... im way too hands on and need to build things... haha
can't get a Japan work visa being self employed i don't think, or it's at least extremely difficult
I heard that a way to get your shorts seen, you have to uncheck the box to send it to your subs
i never even really exploded on youtube, the most ive ever made was about 400 a month
I would love to stream full time and I hope to reach that goal at some point in my life
i dont see your shorts, but i rarely watch shorts
I've never seen your shorts
i dont think they show up in my feed, and i have the all notifications thing ticked
But I'm not sub to anybody, though I see you're full videos on front page
Ive watched imyt Short, im a true imyt fan NODDERS
roflmao, the last mashup was friggin hilarious
i honestly believe my day job is easier than streaming
^all of imyts shorts
Youtube's passe: Imyt's totally blowing up on Truth Social
oh, just going live and throwing up "a stream" is easy, making a career of streaming is crazy hard
my job is pretty easy, but its very physically demanding. its a bit mentally demanding as well, because i have to motivate myself to get up and get out to the shop and start my day
Charles works on the Zippo lighter app
my work is technically very hard to do, but it's easy in the sense of low stress and i enjoy doing it
The ones that do? Sponsorships are a BIG part of it
right now I just stream so that I have a way to show my runs online and as a hobby, i was amazed that i was able to hit Affiliate really quickly
I keep debating leaving California due to cost of living and maybe going full remote.
It's crazy that oats made it this far without sponsorships
move to WA, it's CA but better
LuL
Haha, yeah I like Bellevue/Redmond area
imyts secretly a millionaire from all the 77 bean scams from charles and everyone NODDERS
that's where i live, haha
Nice

Oats was just saying in stream that streaming is harder than any job he's had
Like actually doing it
@cheesyboatride well putting up with chat is a hard job KEKW
Yeah he specified mentally
holy crap, i could never do roofing
that shit's insane
Dude my dad did roofing for a while in his late 50’s
Wild
It’s like so physically demanding
my work drains all my mental capacity
gotta love the backstab damage
which is why it's so hard to work on side projects
aniv HUH
He also mentioned he didn't want to get too much into it because he knew chat would rake him over the coals for it, lol
Mic gain optimized for button clicks NotLikeThis
I work retail at Costco, and even if I’m not talking for an entire stream, I’m still more mentally drained after a long stream than I am after a long shift at work
"showed my tits, still not rich, rip"
KEKW
I had to stop working so much, burnout is real.
nothing is guaranteed, except for death and taxes KEKL
Yeah, at least when you're roofing, you end up with a roof. Art, especially live media, often feels like farting in the wind
its completely RNG that i even found this community
BarbarousKing is one of the hardest working streamers I've seen, he's live like all day
I found imyt through the recommended channels
And making grand poo world I think helped his growth, but it's crazy he has more viewers than grand poo bear now
my best friend came over one day, and was like 'want to have your mind blown? youtube your favorite game and GDQ' and i found oats' channel, then i found you through oats
I found imyt in my heart
we all benefit from you streaming andyLove
Idk how you make a living off full time streaming rn while living in CA
like doesn’t make sense in my brain
But I’m just happy u stream often
Marble Madness while drunk would be crazy
I need to decide if I wanna go into management or keep staying technical next. The age old delima for engineers.
i would stream game dev if it wasn't actually just super fucking boring to watch lmao

@ShiroiTenshii apparently the federal revenue service can tax gifts, so people don't buy stuff outside with other people and import it without taxes, but they have leniencies and stuff like a cartdrige probably wont be taxed, this is more to catch smartphones and stuff

seancaHiYo glhf
fxpak works with the SNES right?
Ah, I was more curious than anything.
shells are cheap, its a few screws... you do gotta buy a screwdriver that works tho
they do sell SFC shells for fx pak pro tho lmao
I have my fxpak in my modded snes jr
I never had the super famicom
modded for better output
its good to have the adapter anyway so you dont have to buy shells for everything
why lose 4 seconds?
yes lol
Yeah, haha
OH lmao nope
KEKW
@leotrinds The Super NT runs at exactly 60fps, not 60.09 or whatever
HmmNotes
i dont have a link but im sure you can find it
you want SFC specifically
If you can get a refund why not?
FC will be like NES
So something like a second every 10 mins.
yeah it all fits
specifically SUPER famicom

yeah you can get different colors n shit

You'd need to cut the shell for the SD and USB though, unless the ones you're looking at already have them cut out.

oh right, the usb
i man, dremel tool?
mean*
i certainly dont have a dremel lol
you think krikzz would sell you another shell lmao
protip on long links, you can delete anything and including after the first "&" symbol. c:
could do a giveaway for the other thing
oop
Yeah, it'll be useful
You should have a snes, a super famicon, a snes-to-fam converter, and shells for both, just to cover all bases
yah i mean if you ever buy another game that has an NA shell you can still use it
@Freyguy55 how can you forget PAL
nope
Just insert the board without a shell SMILERS
i had PAL as a kid, and to use those carts that i now identify as NTSC, i had to use an adapter

gl imyt
-29 at rseries, lost like a minute but was still on WR pace after masamune, then fucked up in magus castle to lose another minute DIESOFPHANTOON
first time anyone acknowledged it that ive seen
in my opinion it should be a simple addition
its probably not that simple just due to the HDMI handshake
@ShiroiTenshii OMEGALUL just saw this message
acknowledging means you have to accept there is a problem
You're wrong imyt
the only argument they should not have it is that it is theoretically a customer support burden that they'd rather just not deal with because people might turn it on who have no idea
I don't know what we're talking about, but I had to
@ShiroiTenshii it'd still be simple to implement, it's just up to the RNG of the receiving HDMI device being able to handle the signal
What about the setting that makes it correct timing?

There's a setting that is supposed to make it do proper timing
slow fast
just with some tearing
4s a huge factor when going for top 10
im not majorly educated on this but isnt "native framerate" a myth because the quartz in the snes isnt machine perfect?
so its like... slightly different for every console

i was trusting that one round mid till the drops
CT doesn't have anything like that that relies on not getting a tear lmao

i voted for map rando last time but I voted hollow this time to see it tiie again
@Eddie KEKW
We want Hollow Knight UltraMad
map randos already got more votes than the whole last poll
more SM after doing runs? NoThanks
hollow knight is dope but SM in any form is superior NODDERS
map rando cheated
hollow knight is awesome
then how come they dont turn up on the LIGHTNING ROUND
yay
but i want to see a map rando
hollow knight ppl be voting and bailing on stream
Yeah, since the usb and sd cards are different
weve had a million hours of hollow night already this week

I don't mind it
LETSGO

Whats wrong with you all lattes? smcharHappyThump
does it grow hair on your chest?
Watch it be a baby seed
desolate?
try a desolate seed
oh also, spin lock is a thing
oh yeah spinlock exists
let's do it imytSippy
kraid and super missiles are ognna be WEIRD
if you have it totally off
screen shake is unneeded
yeah L R X Up
you can lock spin until you shoot
so you can do uwjs easier
or just any sort of wj
up or down wont break spin
LUL
LOL
what should I burn my squillion channel points on
yeah
i get why
@LavaChameleon gamba
its an eddie nerf
i sorta feel that same way buuuut
at the same time i think having a second controller with tape over up and down
i think that's fine too
LOL
i actually thikn that's legit tbh
@shiroitenshii then I'll have even more points 🤣
LOL
cause i mean like
are you gonna ban secret for doing that
he has it cause his up and down are too sensitive i think
ya
bang chains
do we have auto-tracking? do i get the night off pepeW
Gamba: how long until imyt gets angy
:)
:)
i just call it the anti eddie patch
is it a desolate seed?
ok what's kinda funny is osse and i raced on the new patch
I like it
and osse wasn't able to grab the item still
LOL
LOL
he's not the one that patched it btw
but i just thought that was funny
ya
its not a  free trick? whaaaaaa....
its a weird trick
probably not
BUT
if you had to uwu up like
halfie climb
wait is 45 too generous? HUH
then its prob sketchy
yeah
but for the common uwj spots
i can do them all on controller
45 seconds KEKW
@ShiroiTenshii for hard/tricky, it might be a tad, but you never know

Yo thanks @Eddie
so is this with your super nt?
a very long story
icic
do you lose functionality going from FXpak to sd2snes? or are they the same thing
i have no doubt in Oshino's abilities whatsoever :)
so
when do i get to live coach you on one of these
imagine breaking something, then you glue it back together. Then you break it again. Then you glue it back together again
then you break it again again
yeah

this is the perfect derust map rando
@ShiroiTenshii map randos don't have soft lock protection by default
oh
@Eddie Does he really, tho? KEKW
desolate would be pretty mean for a derust
they added caution tape around some door transtions for that
to let you know of potential softlocks

Prayge croc required
so this i would not be doing
you're good
crouch jump
but
i would not have gone down
this isn't in hard i think
because getting back up
is not easy
save at ship, then go get map?
is this Steve Minecraft server!?!?!
yeah
that's not in hard
aniv HUH
two ways you drag up the bugs
but my favorite way is to wj then dboost off the ripper
wj off right ledge and dboost off the ripper
you can drag the bugs up though
i really hate it though
they despwan fast
so i do a delayed wj off the ledge
kind like rightside
gotta time it
well if ur gonna reset, may as well check map
you can break spin to extend the hitbox then boost
in imyt stream, spin break YOU
its not easy LOL
Eddie what did i gamble on?

wow, my eyes are bugging out from the background

if only there was a button combo to prevent unwanted spin breaks maaaaan
yeah cause he's global
you can do it imyt
imytCringe
i don tthink you have to break spin to extend hitbox
but yeah
peepoDoubters
this is hard cause you gotta delay the wj
otherwise you sorta bonk the angle
you can try draggin the bugs up if you want
but that's also kinda bad
CAN YOU NOT JUST JUMP INTO THE RIPPIE AT THE TOP ?
oops caps
nope
he bonk, she bonk the angle... i bonk, u bonk da angle
never surrender!
cmon rippy clippy
yeah LOL
omg
if ur gettn hit at all does that count?

ROFLMAO
grappling beam

interesting spot for grapple
its not a beam according to oats
this is no oatsocracy
charlesSlash
vote beam
oatsSlash
needs HJB
not a beam
or IBJ
the bet does say (not grapple) lol
not without morph bombs right?
you should look at the map some more
Eddie KEKW
@t7g3 shhhh
LOL
LOL
I remember the original Home Alone could easily do a multistream tho
LOL
you got grapple tho
imytCringe
grapple's pretty good
lava dive?
you're favorite room in rando
you can stare at it a bit more if you want
Eddie is FULL of sass tonight LUL
LOL
its not sass tho
yeah you could
i dont know if croc is in logic with your ammo
but its doable
i personally would yeah
its kind of a tricky fight
It IS a tricky seed
Just sayiiiiing
(I know that's not actually what that means)
1 missile means he steps back once
1 super is 3 step backs

when he swips you gotta farm
yeah
imytPoggies
wolflemonDig imytWhine
noice
poor croc
Yo why do the supers look like they're hitting like nerf foam darts?
so now you can actually go underwater there
because you can exit out this way
but for now i think all these goodies are out of logic
because i dont think hard would make you do 10 missile 5 super croc
so i like
peebs are good
morph unmorph downback
i rolloff
unmorphdownback
peepoShake
that's the easiest way to do it imo
yeah fromt he top part
yeah
so the big thing to keep in mind for hard tricky is that croc fight was probably out of logic
ammo too low i think
if you got bad rng
could have been gg
yeah
allow for missing/rng
i'm not sure how much ammo you need for it to be in logic
but hard is like
pretty accessible
so i think
this is an important exercise
i thikn you should probably look at the crateria map
and thinka bout the seed
and what's going on
yup
then what?
its lava dive
lava spark room
Nice
left to right, just tanks
but right to left...
basically when i see an insane amount of crap
guarded by lava dive
i'm thinking the final step is gonna be varia or i'm getting like a tono f etanks
if you see huge amounts of majors locked behind something
then you sorta know the last step is whateve locks that
the biggest thing i'm thinking
if hard doesn't have cf in logic
i feel like brin was next intended logic
is if i can cheese that room i'm gonna go there asap
yeah its possible you can get grav behind that
basically the final step is gonna be a ton of etanks or varia
prob
Mother Brain room time: 1ˢ04ᶠ (1.08 sec)

yeah it could be
but it looks like you're good

i'd have checked the items before going down
👀

Lava dive now?
After some checks
yeah i'd see if i could get the map too
is there a boss you CANT do rn?
not ridley
yeah so if the map is super far
i dont worry too hard aobut it
it basically means there's a long runway
DIESOFCRINGE
coward?

coward is legit this time tho
so dropping down is a softlock

4+1 lava dive doable, and i think we saw majors there, no?
yup
like 10 majors pepeW
lava dive is a big play
oh theres still room peakage
definitely wayyyy out of logic
ok so
witht he save i immediately gun it for phantoon
^
immediately gun it
i spark there
and if you can get back with a spark
you either can get back, or load back with map
then i do phantoon
and get map
yes because this is like
WAYYYY out of the way
so you HAVE todo it now
otherwise you're literally backtracking across thw orld
if you can't then that's just how it is
but like
if anyone does this and you dont
its over for you
whereas if you check and instantly reset
its not as bad
i'd be on the lookout for spikesuit chances too
if there's no instant runway
ok
ya
nice
oh shoot
he's smart

with xray
youc an do this

but with xray you can basically force standup
so he can be even higher
and its ok
so basically freeze him
SMILERS
get on him in morph
so
morph on him
that's too low
still a smidge higher

so like
right -> let go

freeze him higher
you can freeze him super high

you have like 50 etanks before doing this lava dive
LOOL

i think kinda close tbh
AINTNOWAY
peepoSpeed
spiffy lied angy
oh snap, guess we saw wave at post croc green gate
wait
yea wave was down below
ok hold up
gravity isn't here
LOL
i think
it was some beam... BeeLeave
varia might be
but gravity is not
i think
well brinstar is ALL heated rooms
so because you found hjb here
i think that means graivty is out there somewhere
LOL
G'day Imyt
i dont think there's any other way you can get in here
Do enemies n stuff do extra damage in these hard randos ?
wave is down below behind a green gate
in map rando is vanilla
the wrong way
Gotchya
wave is behind a backwards green gate
i was saying the gate was wrong way for GGG mb
maybe there aren't any suits here
LOL
PausersHype
just moonwalk back
into the wall
high jump one is easier
gotcha
just shoot before you hit that little circle
above you
lower
tad late
nice
Ayo
empty ws btw
nvm
2 majors
yo maridia?
@Eddie empty ws btw
LOL
AND maridia
really looking like it
its not
gravity is somewhere else
in the world
unless it loops way around
you're nver getting it
grav is in brinstar?
because you found hjb here
grav is prob where you said it was. past sand hall and cac alley LOL
oh cac alley gigl
what’s desolate mode chat
no way spiffy
LOL it'd be funny
desolate is challenge mode @LavaChameleon
but no extra loot
LOL
challenge mode is the game heavily pigeon holes you into one direction
they added a new mode few days ago
HUH
its pretty brutal
eddie HUH
HUH
ez
HUH
wait
ok gamblers get to keep their money
have you foudn maridia
Eddie in shambles
no eddie
this is the only maridia
HUH
before? any huge loops?
i'm in shambles
unless its in brinstar?
eddies logic in shambles
how
what's going ON
this goes against all that we've seen
maridia COULD still be in brinstar
I DONT UNDERSTAND
we havent seen brin map
there's gotta be a loop right?
this is tame tho
how is there a crayz loop like that
AINTNOWAY
Eddie questioning all his life choices
like some magical journey through narnija
so we're wondering if maridia loops into brin or something
cause this makes no sense to me
LOL
where was grav required
the lava dive
lava dive we think
there's no way back
and he found hjb past lava dive
its either hjb or grav
yeah
its a good play
but i'm so confused
it has to loop right
??
i think so
but in tame map layout it shouldn't really do a huge loop like that
brinstar
we havent seen brin map
this map lol
someone’s going to find Eddie sitting in the corner of a dark room rocking himself back and forth “it doesn’t make sense”
i'd probably go left

thats the largest loop in map rando existance
i wanna see this spoiler map
yeah
we gotta see the spoiler after this
LOL
that's so insane
yeah
wrecked is actually empty
yea, all the bosses are prob there
nope cause it literally loops

That's a crazy map
this map layout is pretty much a circle with two nubs

you gotta get ready to cf

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
it might not be
@imyt Can I shout-out a small art/anime streamer? She could use new vollows
varia
it oculd be screw and space
yea but the font name
xD
i like it a ton, i wanted to use it for another project
understood
hey i wonder if your varia is in that deep ocean major from a while back
LOOOL
cac alley?
oooooo that would make a lot of sense
I know it is, So don't worry about it
wait are you talking to me now? o.o
i just asked for the font name xD
@LadyNanuia naw that was at ellimist
i would just go left tho
oh ok

prob
you kinda need supers
for ridley
farm room is good
yeah
theres a farm room right before ridley, left side
but its a single farm
single farms arent in logic NODDERS
lol i'd agree. but Map rando logic disagrees hard
getting that power bomb DansGame
i detest single farm...
i have to be the hater
hating just to hate tbh
if eddie does do it, no one will

LOL
saved
Saved
you can cook all of this
with screw
kgg
ok you can still 1shot ridley
i swear they patch screw to break spin as often as possible
save 100
becaues if you get grabbed at like 1 hp
you dont drain reserves
until after th animation happens
but you're actually getting cooked
during the animation
if that makes sense
when he grabs you
save enough to panic out of the room after he grabs you
ooo better farm
so basically
if he grabs you when he's dead
you're actually getting cooked still
its like an elevator
so you scam it by getting grabbed with 1 hp but hp in reserve
reserve wont pop in animation
so you're taking damage but you're dejj
yeah
the reserve pops after the animation ends
then you have the time to grab the loot
cooked
nice fight

you took the loop, just backwards
i can't believe the giant loops is real
thats a large loop

no this is correct
it wants you to go through lava dive
and come out from brin
really?
no this is what you didd
yellow is return
white is the way you go
oh no, he's right
you did it correct
its in logic because you CAN loop
this is why
i can't believe
its in tame

Wym speedrunner daer? Touhou is all auto scrollers
I mean, the stages are, but I figured bosses have some variability in how fast you can get them down
(I have never beaten a boss in Touhou I am bad at bullet hells)
Oh I guess so
Sounds miserable as a speedrun tho

who's buying them all lol
is this super metroid??
oh they are very expensive
monkaW
they are expensive as well right?
What kind of size are you looking for?
check with KNO_3, I think he finds them often
🤣
Hot take is getting the rt4k is better than a pvm
zanianArrive
But what's most important is what you want to play
charles bongoWave
Funny enough the PVM price is only half of the problem....shipping is the other half.
charles samusGood
@sheeples23 samusGood
yooooooooo imytWork
GLGL homie
Like I was talking about charles about PVM, but shipping it over to Japan cost more than the PVM itself LUL
that's a good question and idk
there are probably some calculators online that can convert
I think...
how big is it wide screen
charles' pvm was sick
I only got 14's atm :(
14 inch is good when you are right in front of it pepeOk
and a broken 20 that I haven't put the effort into finding someone to fix
oh we're talking about screen size 😳
the common PVM sizes are like 20" and 14", but i wish there was like a 17"
I used to have a 14inch crt that I played my snes and ps1 on it
😳
oh, i got my axe eaten jaycNot
@jakoliath 🍆 minoFlushed
it was fine on the table on my face

aniv charlesSlash
@leotrinds we talkin about pvms or
yes
yes
yep
😊
but 14inch of 3:4 display will be a bit different form your 16:9 display
HUH
oh you are measuring just the capture
14 so small 😭
I will close gamba in 2 minutes dinkDonk
you thinkin' bout joining PVM gang? samusPausers
14 seems above average to me
ajnebPeek
I like 24 inch monitors
more than that is so fucking huge, on your face
wjy
using retro consoles as a reference in this is kinda weird cause they have like overscan and garbage on the edges of the screen sometimes
why*
but yeah i also think 14" seems a little small

yeah
cutie's crt is like
8"
i think
maybe 7
Hrm do you know anyone local in your area that can fix a CRT?
thats fuckd up
LOL
zeni bought a little like 4" pvm to take traveling
frydiNODDERS
crazy to me
I'm speculating it's mostly bad caps, but I can't promise anything
omg 4"
its tiny
maybe it was a bit bigger than that
but yeah, super small
@twinmo23 bigger than my
Oshino
i think oshino does
yeah
he does that
it depends on what is broken but yes
those capacitors are huge
yea they can kill u if u don't know what ur doin
they can send you flying off the room
yes opening a CRT can kill you

Autism dog*
a 20" broken PVM
I work on electronics and working on a CRT scares the shit out of me.
hey aniv got a bot icon
my dad and grandpa used to have a business selling and repairing crt tvs
there were many times they got zapped
monkaEXTREME
but they had all the right things to help minimize the risk
wonder how much of that knowledge is getting lost to time since CRTs not produced anymore
I remember hanging out at the shop and being told repeatedly NOT to touch anything on the back of a tv that was open
I know my dad doesn't remember much
plus he can't do all the small soldering that was needed for some of the repairs
i probs have some required YT videos for you to watch that i think are helpful for PVMs
cause i think you just have to know about some of the intricacies with these things
you dont need to know a ton about sync but i think you should at least know a little bit
imo motion blur is not just a thing that just looks pretty, it actually makes the screen sharper and easier to see when you are moving
i've heard zeni talk about that too
no
you can't
120 Hz with black frame insertion might be comparable, idk
it's like a weird thing about LCD monitors in particular, there are paths around it potentially if you do what @jakoliath said
it's supposed to reduce the blur since there's a fully dark frame between each game frame
InternetBoundArrive
oats said that whenever his pvms shit the bed he will not buy a new one and will use monitors
sync is a signal that tells the CRT how to position the picture on the screen

cause he's ona different part of your hitbox
when you're going up and down
do you have to fire the shot earlier in the fall
so the cue for where to freeze him
its
if you look at the walls
there's like
two black tiles
then a green tile
then black tiles tot he left
yeah
so you'd freeze him as if he's on top of the green tile
the one that sticks out
yeah
i think its 2 pixelsof leniency
so it'd be like 3 pixels lower than that
its down shot when going up, and up shot when falling
then you morph unmorph on him
and crouch jump
if you're falling
you up shot
if you're jumping up
its a crouch shot

you need one more for MB
No he's got enough with reserves for MB and Ridley
oh tru he has reserves

depends if u want varia Shruge
With 35 supers you're good but you have to do hitless basically
I'd say charge your reserves first
well full reserves is kinda req
And you know about the reserve manipulation for getting grabbed?
Leave 100 in
min 100
so you can grab drops after he grabs you
At least 100 and you wanna be in the air at drops when they appear

balatro is better imo

Marmu S tier always
marmu can eat my shorts

yea mantis lords 2nd and 3rd row
bottom left
er now 2nd
it changed
Mid left
middle right
5th on 2nd row is mantis lords
Okay I just got here and I'm already mad at your rankings lol
Poor Hornet
Marmu is D tier at best
far right is mantis lords with all 3 at once
grimm S tier NODERS
NODDERS
I hate enraged guardian the most
Mantis lords/sisters of battles, aren't the hardest, but holy fuck the pace is god tier.
It really feels like you're dancing between the 3
holy wow
venge over god tamer WHAT
wheres our boy gorb going?
nice
in the trash leo
this guy is F tier
just hit and go back
mawlek is lame

this one is the one I hate the most
specially when you do it on the story
and the little minions dont die on one hit
flukemarm is... Shruge
fuck that shit
this other one is the spider that flies, only on p5
the other one is alt version in P5 that flies
HUH
yea soul warrior
I feel like that variant was a downgrade, where it wasn't really harder, but it made it even slower as nosk just flew around.
"upgraded" nosk i lame and just annoying
marmu only C? cynanmMarmu
crystal guy again
this is false kight and failed champion
the giant armor guy
watcher knights on E Madge
the black one is crystal guard again
imyt had baby mode for watcher knights
he went there SUPER late
you didnt do that fight on the right time in the game
like just before HK
yes
the black crystal is crystal guy revisited
what about hollow knight
doing double damage
and faster
theres a rematch
one is false knight
Dung defender, S++ tier battle cry
other is failed champion
one is the early one, one is the rematch harder one
Use code IMYT or follow the link https://madrinas.coffee/imyt to get 20% off your next Madrinas order! Slurp up dat coffee
what about the white dung boy then
ye
yes
ninten152DOG ninten152ToeJAM
white is faster, but yea sameish
OH OH WAIT
YOU FINISHED IT?
2nd boss is the crystal dude, but he hits double
ALSO HI!
hi kona
we did not clear P5, but otherwise game is "done" for now
this is the scythe guy
@KonaChocolate imytWave
Howdy imyt!
the other black one is the 2nd hornet fight
in kingdom edge
you have fought all of these
but the first one
thats the hornet fight with the needle traps
the sleeping fly is a miniboss in crossroads
Cheer25 Donating more geo to the fountain.  Also for timeout immunity.
LUL
imytChonk
2nd one is dude with a spinning axe that bounces around
LUL
third one is your favorite mantis fight
oh shit
i love this song RatJamming
third one now is lost kin dream fight
kinda hard
but not relaly
the dream version of this
harder
this is the harder
the one without orange is the harder
I forgot the actual name of it
hollow knight
and pure vessel
uhh 2nd from last is pre-final boss
which is hollow knight young
hollow knight
this game OST is so bueno
PogChamp
and pure vessel is this but super sayan
thats the P4 boss
you fought both
you practiced pure vessel
3rd is dude with spinning shield and platforms
now only the fly miniboss, the dream fight on kingdoms edge you went there to unlock p4 and mantis traitor
Boss to the right was where cloth died
traitor lord
I think
traitor lord
trairor lord
he does hit for 2 HP
and you cant fight him without the dash
gruz mother
send this straight to dumpster
no
gruz mother
gruz mother
probably the most forgettable boss
good place NODDERS
it's basically the first miniboss you fight in the game
easy to forget
yea maybe
yeah thats all it do
spikes? HUH
the ascended fight has spikes
leafy :(
oh HmmNotes
good tierlist
im 80% with your S tier NODDERS
zote is a meme, but he can just be a meme in F tier angy
for me Pure Vessel and Radiance are S tier

shiroi do the bindings to unlock the butterflies during p5 Prayge
we're doing mapos?
butterflies? NoThanks
fine dont do the bindings Madge

ez pz
binding sound uninteresting TBH
nerf youself so you have to take longer pepeW
First Kill / Turret / 100 CS?
I cant do all bindings at once to anything thati snt p1
and even then its hard af
KEKW
the mask binding might be ok to do tho
I find the mask the second hardest
the hardest is charms
yea charms
soul and nail bindings dont make anything harder
i can probably hitless P1,2 and 4
just slower pepeW
yeah
would take some attempts... but i could
yeah
@ShiroiTenshii then you can do mask
but if you cant do hitless, mask is a big hinderence
P3 has zote tho ReallyMad
zote is so easy shiroi cmon pepeW

Alright. I'm back

Would it be better to set up a multi world for map rando? And start there? Or are they all pretty much the same
you turn on the controller
you mean sm map rando? i dont think its supported yet
Sefi can't let you out drink him KEKW

hey Sefi
dst is heckin Weirdge, feels so early, but its almost midnight haha! how you doin imyt?
imyt and big whoppin' stick KEKL
decreases charge time on the dash skill iirc
pumpkin woods is no joke. its harder than like the next 3-4 areas
mechanically i mean
not terrible from what ive done, but not fully viable by itself
10k yea
boars dont give a single fuck lmao
yea stinger is real good early game
yea is sefi charges it he should have 2 shadows now
you can freeze bosses actually, its nuts at times
most of them at least
Does it recognize you if you are a ghost?
Couldn't wait for Andy, had to get back to the grinding mines? :D
The good thing is there's so many skills and builds that it's insanely replayable. Especially arcade
I like to put a point in Provoke just to scream at my friends in co-op for 0 EP LUL
LUL
Great anti-AFK "get yo ass back to the computer" skill
lol
playing a full support build in 4player is actually super fun. stuff that just doesnt work solo/duo
2 hand for magic is crazy good ep sustain with the souls eater talent for mobs

3ep per hit that the ranged swing hits
2H has the beam wave, pierces enemies and breaks obstacles. Also, there's a very janky, funny build exclusive to 2H summoners. Summons eating all your EP? That's fine, berserk doesn't need EP LUL
Rage Summmoner!
smashlight is pretty worth, bit it does take a sec to get
It's usually used to boost another skill. Berserk builds up charges and EP, pump it into another skill for Mega Unga Bunga damage
But yeah, without the Cube accessory Shadowclone and Berserk do lack the 'fun' factor. It's practically a build defining item for basic attacks
cube is pretty good for a 1h build yea
Could you drop yours and he equips two?
I hope Andy gets to experience the casino of nonsense that is Cube :D
touhouman
sefi rippin ass over there
Funnily enough, Gigaslime has more blood on his hands than Phaseman
Some people have died to Gigaslime for an hour... on Normal
Whenever I get Cube in Arcade I immediately start assembling pins that feed into basic attack like I'm creating Exodia. Bosses just explode LUL
fun fact, the shadow clone is actually super nerfed from what it used to be back in early beta like 2015-16 ish. it was comically strong
@walozdle That was pre-talents. They kinda had to nerf Shadowclone for Insult to Injury and Backhander to exist
true, but even then it was still stronger then than the full build now from what i remember at least
i remember my bro feeling like he wasnt even there lol
30 is alot
its 30 more than base, which is 6per sec
LUL
in my exp, shadow clone build and full flamethrower build seem to be top single target nukes, but id bet shadow clone come out ahead
stinger is def contributing a bit lol, but its will fall off soonish
you can yea
A lot of bosses have unique animations for a PG. Like Phaseman's green orb
NOOOO 7 seec
NOOOO
Meteor and Earthspike are pretty satisfying, high DPS high skill builds
meteor hits super hard, but it feels better used as a perfect guard punish spell to me than a primary one
They have free range targetting
like a chicken?
being some of the few spells that can be targeted diagonally is a factor too
There is that talent that gives +60% to PG windows, makes that build more viable
dude i did an enh shaman build way back, it wasnt bad, thought that was years ago
Probably the biggest high skill build in the game is Static Touch. Hybrid magic/melee skill, the longer you go without taking damage while attacking the more powerful the static cubes becomes
i did back then, but 1h is prob better
albeee0

raid
FeelsGoodMan
Yeah, you can see the cubes cycling through colors to indicate they're powering up. More Info explains it well
Frozen does have a crit/crit dmg boost I think? Not sure, haven't seen its More Info in a bit
respect for not using the health potion though, def cracnks up the difficulty

frosty friend with the "get down Mr president" on  some of those shots lmao
meteor is dope, dont know how good it is before rank 3 though
People tend to get Reapers Blade with Spike or Meteor
Super fills it up
shield spell is goated tho too
I'm assuming you've never played with the golfing ability, Smash? LUL
just about every spell/ability is good in it's own situation, which is why this game is so damn good lol
Clap

PGing this dude into oblivion is super satisfying

You can cancel it by shielding
PGing the 4-hit combo is so much more satisfying, but I don't know if the wooden shield can handle it

I can highly recommend loading him up in singleplayer at the arena to 4x combo PG. Dude deserves it LUL GG
the red slime again NotLikeThis
meteor is actually really good here. i used meteor build to kill him at like lv 11 or something just cause it can attack diagonal and far away
People who don't want to use Blink just bully him down with Dodging Strike instead
Constantly perfect hopping back and forth
Beating Gundam upgrades all the shops here
I am now wise in the ways of the hard mode, working on final dungeon. Spoiler for rest of the game: it's hard.
I very much cheesed this gentle slime. Still took forever.
Literally one month before launch I realized that this boss wasn't scaled and brought it up, if it was an oversight.
I wonder how many deaths that one question has lead to
LUL
Once I got it, the actual run was quick. Just took a million tries. kelpLUL
I could call the run on this guy I did "skill" based, but it was basically lucking into do exactly what I needed to do every time.
Super easy to tell how many hops he's gonna do by watching the eyes. If they squint as soon as he lands, boys about to boing again
Crush only temporarily removes your shield. Like, for 4 seconds.

Attractiveness is subjective, and fashion changes all the time. Imagine getting 2 inches taller and then being short is more popular later. It could happen.
I'd take a partner with charisma who is short over a partner who is tall and arrogant

@qbit_jblair bastio20LoveV3 dspitHeart hi qbit!
hard agree imyt
dread is the best metroid for me
@bastion_blue_succubus87 Hi Bastion! bastio20LoveV3 dspitHeart
metroid 5 is in my top 3 metroid games for sure
if I had to choose a game between SM & Dread I'd pick SM over dread any day
I think the Dread vs SM discussion is interesting.  I think overall dread is probably more enjoyable, but I think there's something to be said about the fact that SM came out like 30 years ago.
This game is so sick in the head that you can't shoot on the ground so the flying enemies don't even fly. They just go straight to the fucking ground and attack you. It's so stupid. I can't handle flying enemies that don't wanna fly because they know being on the ground is stronger. It actually makes me mad. They just go to my knees. You're a flying creature and you're deciding to stay on the ground because the game is horrible.
for casual play, Dread is the better game
YEP so when are you learning CT imyt, next week?
SM is monumental, legendary even
prime is good too
I'm also not a fan of dreads button mashing
yeah the whole age is a thing of itself but dread still takes it over sm
i wanna play SOTN, but I wish I could play it on SNES
monkaW
No Fury - that's a charm at the very beginning; it was skipped
75% iirc
Been lurkin in and out since the climbing game. Building a PC right now. It's cool to see the speedrun of HK. Are you thinking about trying it out, Imyt?
fury is kinda slow to grab
He has 3 notches. Shaman takes 2 and Fury takes 2
But maybe it's because i'm older that I prefer the older games over some of the newer ones.
shaman is 3, no?
I considered it Bastion, but then I watched the run LUL
I understand
Sadge2 imyt getting my hopes up and going for hollow knight instead
hollow knight speedrun is super tight
@Zoey_Bee_ it looks wild
It might be 3, I'd have to check
I can tell you you would probably learn it pretty quick
it's 3 unless 1221 patch is diff
which I dont think it is
imytCool
The inputs are insane for me because I do ridiculous optimizations, but there's also lots of downtime where you're just mashing text
yes
Spicy
damn that shmovement
New Game+ Any% is very doable. I think its a 10 minute run.
yeah theres a field in steam you can access any build from
but yeah imyt I'm pretty sure you could pick up CT pretty quick
on steam is literally right click, properties, patch 1221

elden ring Pog
do elden ring coop as a collab!
I would literally watch every second
Elden ring is pretty sick
best game of all time SMILERS
this is wall cling storage
I love SM speedrunning. But I can't watch that so much all the time. I mostly watch rando races/other contents. imytFade
So are you saying there is a chance for SMZ3 multiworld? :)
leotrinds which game?
it's only legal in specific topography in any%
i just put on my headset
elden ring
keyboard
oh i havent played it yet, but it looks awesome
It's KBM I think
you should check out gravity rush since its cute and short ish
keyboard feels bis for sure
3d game tho
He's got arrow keys and Esc/Enter
too hard to do precise pogo shit on roller
i believe there are some guys that run with controller
controller for sure casually
but for speedrun you kinda need to do keyboard
xbox elite maybe
You'd burn up your controller I feel
PS5 is probably the best i'm guessing
Hollow Knight, Rock Band Drum Set %
Fuck that dash lol
Correct
yep its a skip
does the dualsense edge have clicky dpad?
He does another one too
no isma's tear, those wallclings are very tight
I tried the second one myself
I use an xbox controller for SM and yeah the dpad is kinda bad lol
it is tight
its kinda tough, you gotta stop before touching the wall and its pretty quick
the one in Queens Garden is crazy hard, that one is tight but comfyish
Jamgie
I can at least make it work tho
I know it decently, I'm no good at it tho
this is funny cause oats doesnt like the dualsense dpad and prefers the xbox one at least iirc
I don't know the speedrun for hallow knight
just consumed a lot of rando and any% content between some HK content creators
ps4 controller > ps5
Honestly, the Switch Pro controller just feels so good to me
you want more of the one off attacks than the chain attacks but it is what it is
God that damage LUL
you can do the one cicle
if they are gamer they will two cycle
Imyt he's Dream Nailing it for Soul to cast spells btw
Oh shit, the game I was waiting on released. I'm out peepoVanish
new game Pog
you basically need a very specific order of nail hits and vs casts there to ensure maximum damage each cycle, there's no gimme room
The Mines of Titan roguelike
first dreamer makes infected crossroads happen, doesnt matter which dreamer
It's a good category of games to love
It's turn based, but the build making and content looks good

or unpatched? idk
Damage warp
samusLewd
this is not current patch, it's 1.2.2.1 @SEFI
ya i figured
but most of the skips other than lever skips are still in current patch
its the patch that added grimm I think
inventory drops are....different/less prevalent in current patch
The fights would take practice
Accessible runs are pog
from experience, a lot of the hk stuff is very approachable yeah
There is definitely less of a need to learn basic movement than in SM
and there's tons of resources avail
fighting the bosses without upgrades is hard

looks like letting go of rock late

Yeah, I beat it
imyt wont believe me, but he was playing balatro last night when i beat this game
4.5 hours
getting over it took me like 15 hours the first try
i hated controller for this - once i got used to mouse it was so much better for managing my momentum
Rocks were the hardest part for me
i imagine this would be the same
this stuff tilts me so much, i have to get up and take little walks around the room often
bye imyt LOL

that’s nutty
dude this guys core is nuts
I don't, I just went really slow but deliberate
I only used the mouse
slow and careful is the Bennett Foddy way
probably the Orange Hell section
yep that's orange hell - immediately after the orange table
you gotta go super slow thru there until you work it out
I did it like that
that was an attempt

@Obedmaziah they add more points of stop on the gc analog
Ah, gotcha
Close
Too much momentum and lost grip
Yeah, kinda get to get really high on it
I would be anti-hitbox if it wasn't so hard and/or expnsive to get good OEM controllers
PepeLaugh
it introduces neutrals though
but that's already something that limits runners' potential
so serious question, is it legal currently for SM right now?
yeah Zoap it is
are there any notable runners currently?
or is it similar to melee where there is like 2-3 people who are top 30
My feeling is that if hitbox is advantageous, you're welcome to switch
But if you keep using controller it's because you think that's better for you
did eddie start on conch?
Zanian is starting up again on hitbox
I'd suggest trying hitbox first, it has its own challenges
social security today
It's not just legal because it's not addressed, it's been explicitly allowed
@a_n_i_v sounds like a scam aniv Susge
So if you like it better then go for it
Read the message before that
You missed one
That's interesting
do you think itd ever become its own category?
oats wins :(
Not yet
that would be hillarious

yea, I think i know what im doing up to Hornet
maybe you need more power on the swing

KEKW
oats very visibly recoiled at that sentiment KEKL
Nah, I just used mouse
space/w works well
Do the swing you were doing, but at the bottom of the swing move the mouse straight up

after u enter the door are u holding run and forward the whole time?

sounds correct
probably stutter longer
like let go of left longer
before repressing it
nah you repress before
all of that for a missile
believers o7
i'm not sure honestly, i just keep doing it until i get it
but its close for sure
The slowdown looked good but the lack of blue means the repress happened too late, after the transition

you dont have the hp anymore
now no hp for spark KEKW
this is not how you win my gamba fyi
u could scout the item?

yes
just win believer points

looks like your repress timing is sometimes not when you're pressing left
what difficulty does this jump start being logically required?
Yo imyt, I've got good news and bads regarding that climbing game
yeah its just really hard
you're doing it totally right just have to whip a little faster
its tough
yeah
@DraiDraken Extreme
yup
exactly
its not just you
the jump timing is really why this is hard
@maddo15 oh dang
I found a consistent strat with mouse only, but I couldn't get it to work with W and spacebar ;_;
I tried mang
Wait, is this wall jump underwater possible?
@Obedmaziah it is yes
Jesus, looks awful
is cheaters here?
re-whipping is what most people get owned by
the fact that you can even re-whip is pretty good
LOL
ur killing ur wrist :(
are you one finger tapping the d-pad? could try 2 finger alternating with like, middle and index fingers if it helps?
our first whip and your subsequent are not the same speed
with Spin Lock, you can still break spin with angle up or angle down. It just affects d-pad up/down
did I come at a gross time?
so your jump is going on the same rhythm
takin the dining-rooms, all were like shmire shmemblem
but whip one and whip 2 are not he same
rooooooofl
you can do this pepeOk
peepoCheer
whip
I am.  I punted my first WSOP event this year in a big way and im frustrated
That looked good dood
I believe in you imyt!
basically you're pressing jump too early

Don't use your brain! Use your SM instincts! Or the force...whichever works
sup nevdi
is eddie here
yeah there he is LOL
its because
and thi shappens to everyone
your first wj is good
This is actually a very hard thing to do
oooooooooooo
the second one is never the same speed
@Nevdi there's like a batsignal that goes out whenever someone is playing a map rando, his spidey sense tingles
so its diff on the timing

📋 Sorry @leotrinds, that's incorrect. 😭 The correct answer is: [B] Nick Nolte
technically i dont think so
No, TAS can do this stupidly fasr
just gotta start cookin and evaporate all the water
TAS do it impossibly fast so probably no
nah this one is hard
This needs like 8 or so
oooo
felt like it was the one
probalby need 10 clean ones
If this isn't edging I don't know what is
i dont think osse can do this one
i think usually i do the first one, second one is slower so i brace myself
then after that its all rhythm
but one and two are different
you've still been like 6 jumps away still
so i would say not that close unless you rapidly sped it up
Yo this grind is making me really wanna push for practice grinds
if you killed 4 of them

Have a good night
imytSleeper
Aaand, we're back to a PB 😂
thank you for the stream!
This game is so sick in the head that you can't shoot on the ground so the flying enemies don't even fly. They just go straight to the fucking ground and attack you. It's so stupid. I can't handle flying enemies that don't wanna fly because they know being on the ground is stronger. It actually makes me mad. They just go to my knees. You're a flying creature and you're deciding to stay on the ground because the game is horrible.

Got a spare mouse to try?
Maybe the issue is that this game is also too boring and free?
@Bhbgamergirl yo Bhbgamergirl
would this be a good game to break in a new mouse

I kind of agree to some extent. I see it as a challenge of mental fortitude and prolonged execution
It's a battle against fatigue, which I find interesting
Haha I guess just keep in mind that beating P5 was a big accomplishment for some
I don't mind doing the same thing over and over again, and I like battle against fatigues
I love endurance races KEKW
And like you only tried it once so it's sadge to hear
Well, you *do* speedrun SM on a regular basis LUL So you've got practice on fortitude

I forget the aspect name, but my favorite weapon is bow

Fist is cheeser shit tbh
oh cool a_n_i_v is here hey a_n_i_v
man heart rend on Chiron bow with concentrated volley is pure cheese
Aniv is real. ANIV He is all, and we are He. Omniscient and ever-present; ruthless and merciful. To Him we are bound into eternity, and by His grace we are forgiven our sins Prayge
That's not....
I thought shield was easy mode in hades 2
Okay lol. I know there's a command
I suck at the shield lol
@gameaholic2d same. Rail was cheese too
aniv was talking to me earlier, something about getting trevor and sypha together lol
Aniv's original name was A_Normal_Imyt_Viewer. Aniv is a bot that learns to speak from other chatters through a Markov Chain system

yes it is really bad
i heard people say its bad but i played ds3 on steam for a bit
and i thuogh it was fine
aniv charlesSlash
I feel like dodging with mouse/keyboard would be pain
imytCringe
i was just wondering if people were bad
LOL
play with controller and you will see
alright ima brb, i need to get some food
its probably not that bad and people are still feeling the sting of DS1 M&K but controller is definitely more comfy
I don't feel I need the specificity of M+KB and a controller feels more comfortable over long periods, that's why I use it
also btw what time you wanna play tomorrow?
i think i might have a friend that want to play with us
I’m speaking as a console gamer tbh

you don't have a shielf
you dont have shield equiipped
It's also block if you two hand your ax4e
you can also combo inputs like pressing forward+r2 same time is a different attack somtimes

there are shields to parry, guard counters, and there are mods that add perfect parries
i mean you need a shield to parry
but you can block counter witha 2h
does this not have daggers or w.e that also parry?
i dont remember
probably
I never used tho
some daggers also parry

The first time I played Elden Ring I never even saw that guy until like 20 hours in
OMEGALUL daer
so how does this go, eat a bean for every death
that was good
I missed the tutorial boss, was he close?

@movingfloors you mean the forced death? or the knight?

I remember when i first played dark souls 1 I had the same problem
Use the bonfire to get more flasks
nah just go with that
You aren't using magic
I see some blue there
psh, clipper! peepoShy
just realocate the hp flask to mp on grace
the game taught you that
Talking about flasks
L2 uses FP
the blue is there for show
you will have 4 hp flask
You can sawp how much are HP and MP
You can turn the magic flask into a healing flask
Just a small suggestion
It's a funny first fight to pick
Withholding all else
I want to enjoy this ifrst playthrough
>Grabs popcorn
You can allocate flasks
bet he can do it tho
go to grace, reallocate flasks
you know the really nice part of an open world game? not having to fight things you dont want to
put the FP flasks into HP flasks
jsut do it
while siting at the grace

@a_n_i_v peepoHey
this is the one miryaParty miryaParty
yo that horse can wall ride
might want to rebind crouch at least KEKW
He panic gripping to stick barbHereitcomes
damn, you both jump attacked. like a couple of ninjas
45% damage tho 👀
its not that useful
we've come from them.
oh noo miryaSob miryaSob
Immy-chan
it was off I think
@a_n_i_v that's true
auto lock on just locks on to the next guy after you kill one guy
I think...
oh you play with an xbox control pad miryaLurk
do something stupid like hold Trinagle + r3
see if you can do that
Hmm
you are not going ot use spells right?
put on UP
OMEGALOOL
Up is used
Spells
can you bind it to a keyboard key?
Wait yea
Immy
use Up
You aren't using spells
For meow
just git gud gigl
spells
it change spells
Swap spells
what's up dog
up on d pad is only fr spells
hold tirnagle + r1
Dpad changes squipment slots
"there are no bad controls, only bad players" - Shigeru Miayamoto
wrong bind KEKW
YOU BINDED THE WRONG THING
Swap that one
Yo uhave to swap both
that was the wrong control
I know but for this fight
Cause it's irkying you
no
it is just menu for spells
literally jus change spells
iisnt it much better than crouching?
still better than crouching
triangle + r
it explained to you
i dont understand how you press L3 when moving Shruge
hold triangle
STICK DRIFT
stick drift doesnt L3 tho HUH
he just press the controller too hard probably
maybe not stick drift but a wonky stick
I crouch on horseback, which takes me off triKEK
death counter NODDERs
just keep adding
KEKW
just randomly add some every few minutes gigl
you are at the wrong flask
press down
press down
good fight tho
counter KEKW
great fight to learn controls
this is a hard fight for people that know the controls
learning while in the fire
if you can beat this fight then you can beat the game
ErinGo Bragh
counter
you have to pavlov death -> counter
does ER have egregious button queueing?
jugaría, pero los servicios Kappa
This boss truly is the perfect tutorial for this game
not the worst but its definitely kinda bad tenshii
its not THAT different
Different director
controls are the same layout
Wait Dark Souls Too
Or Dark Souls II
lmao
@Etuca Given this game though
It is
DS2 has the worst controls. maybe this is too good
they fucked with the timing so that dark souls players would have to struggle
youre comparing it to the worst game in the souls series from 10 years ago when this game is meant to allow you more freedom in playstyles
the spice must flow
ds2 controls like poop close to this
dune 1 is such a tease haha
can you customize controls to your liking?
somehwat
you wouldnt want attack on square tho
this game punishes you hard for rolling pre-emptively
you have to stay in and roll only when you need
you gotta roll on parry timing dood
running never works
just remove running from your brain during fights
after watching this like 3 times its just your timing tbh
counter
death counter
optional boss
OMEGALOOL
@wordsinthemind Shush
you cant parry those huge ass enemies
Swimmers
aw
this is just a world mob, not really a boss
Shhhhh, let him figure things out
my dad is in the mob @Stealthtoucan
it has a boss HP bar Shruge
Like I said, this boss is a good tutorial
we need a controller log
fair
at this point it's a boss, LoL
@Stealthtoucan nah this is a boss
Love to see it
W ANIV
Damn ANIV
you fight capra demon later, doesnt mean it isnt a boss
aniv is trying to tilt you
hp bar = boss is fine
i should play this game again...
L3 is sprint in shooters
L3 to run... halo?
wasnt run Circle in Dark Souls
bind run to l3 then KEKW
Yep, and L3 to jump
(while running)
I play with Tilt Controls :)
lmao
you will learn
most people come to this game having played dark souls
i personally would rebind to what feels right, i would make L2 jump dont ask me why
would keyboard be better since you’re better with it?
Nah
We need to get a SNES controller out
tbh
you do NOT want to play on KBM KEKW
sometimes yes
sometimes
nah you gotta see cracked players
they parry everything
i wanna be them fr
A Difficult Game about Controls
it's a game of thrones
you can only parry human like enemies
this is too big to parry
yeah thats dark souls style, one hit every 3-5 enemy attack
you got the runs treating ya so far
thanks aniv
HE DISCOVERED DARK SOULS STRAT POGGIES
try to stay on his shield side
he's beginning to believe
"the game is simple once you realize it's just dodge and hit, after you learn that, you learn the game ain't shit" -Tupac
TUPAC??
lmao ryu
I miss Tupac's streams
peepoShake
It's a dunkey meme
lol
I'd just let go, 500 souls is nothing
now you dont need to get it back
look to sun tzu
I remembered the Souls I lost, so i could farm for them latter
at least there is no durability here
this boss is not mandatory
gotta take control of the fight
Glgl with your playtrough Imyt, pain begins :D
At the end of the day, it's a video game with hitboxes.
and its totally meant to fuck newbies
you jumped to close to him so the halberd hitbox got you
when you are far you can kinda jump
Like I said
Leo
I'ts the perfect tutorial
For this game specifically
To teach you the core of it all
dont rely on jumps for dodges
Jumping doesn't have i-frames, but it does remove some of your hitboxes
innit imyt
I'll let him come to the conclusion of what that is though
But I think you know what I mean
@RyuVincent agree, if you beat this then you can beat the game
i forget, dodge has I frames right?
@Stealthtoucan oatsBozo
@Stealthtoucan Hmm, hm.
dodge has i frames
bump that shit up to 25
the game is designed around the fact dodge has i frames
@Stealthtoucan Not quite that
you cant parry big enemies
@leotrinds i beleive it
damn nice block
when you tried to block you got hurt
Shield isn't 100% phsical block
without a shield, block still damages I think
Think that one is like 95%
some shields are
his axe isnt
and my bow
the attacks adapt to position right?
you are clearly learning tho
I think they baited Imyt to fight this to fuck with him
he started phase 2 for the first time
KEKW
HUH
Myazakiii
You can see he's still hiting L3
lmao
He's getting there. Damn
tip of the halberd got weird
it isnt
trust me
unbind run donkBlush
It's all a dance
Enemies have extended hitboxes
All attacks ahve wind-ups
you dont wanna unbind run KEKW
Field bosses are intended to be fought with a faster movement option, ijs
need to be more methodical with your attacks
Sometimes shockwaves can  linger
You're going in aggressive and being greedy
SO you're reacting to him
No the other way around
Not*
another thing to take into account is positioning, this guy has a harder time hitting you from his shield side
^
He does have that quick shield bash bs though
I hate it Vincent
I don't think I've seen the shield bash
The real lesson of this boss is that all bosses aren't mandatory
better that than the double hit stun he keeps getting fucked with
kinda of, Thorgi
Shhh
Let him come to that conclusion
he will learn
You baited him to fight this and come to a different conclusion lol
once you learn this become the most satisfying thing ever
the iframes on the roll are kinda surgical. they end pretty quick
your dodge is your parry
you gambled on him beating it Thorgi HUH
command buffering is a thing
^
is this your first boss?
if you hit dodge while dodging you can end up dodging again
I thought ya'll were fucking with him by making it a bet in the first place. He hadn't gotten past the TOS KEKW
great way to learn the game
LOL
it is a boss
but absolutely optional
you could go the other direction
There was the tutorial
and meatn to fuck newbies
it has a boss healthbar
But they learn leo
I'M ALIVE
That you can go to the four winds
so my advice is ignore chat at all times and ENJOY, this game is fucking amazing
Ok Aniv D:
yeah
The world is your oyster
aniv peepoS
but dont ignore me ok ty

Yo Charlezard!
How tilted do you think Immy is going to get
Once he goes to foreskin
gets*
he is clearly learning
i expect maximum tiltage this play through and im here for it
im very excited, hope i get to watch often
you gamble when you do those jumps when he jumps
it works sometimes because he missed his halberd
you are counting on him missing you
Want to talk about hitboxes
Go back to DS2

one thing to know is that the AI is also reacting to everything you do immediately, its not going to be consistent because it knows what to do against you RIGHT AWAY. you basically have to bait it to open itself up
those bosses? yes
Depends on the situation
they use for this boss for sure
it depends from boss to boss
or else the camera work gets too finnicky
sometimes the lock on it's an enemy
@leotrinds Getting hit at times was like what the fuck even is this game
counterintuitive, but you can roll toward the boss
In my heart strings with the level where is the chain whip?
Lock on i good for thrust attacks.
Oh wait, talking about this game not DS2
hold B back to run KEKW
lol
lol
I hate those bosses too ryu
@a_n_i_v the guy in the town sells it
you wait for it to swing the last attack in its sequence so it has to wind up its next one
bump that counter to 40 no joke
KEKW
Do you want me to time out/delete all the backseating messages? Just wondering
Yeah everyone is massively backseating
imyt ignoring chat, as usual pepeW
Sounds good
here I got the best tip for Imyt. All he needs to do is get the bosses hp to 0 while his stays above 0. its EZ if you think about it
charles, he was asking the chat a lot of things too
its fine
Imyt Sup
Charles sup
I've only played DS1 and it feels like I'm halfway ish into ds2
is there any spicy gamba to be had GAMBA

Wellll, the previous conversation
Without the topic
Is one I keep telling people to avoid
and they keep bringing mention
Something he needs to find out on his own
cheerge LETS GO IMYT cheerge
Besides that, we've been tame
yeah he is learning
Is this your first souls game?
sorta yes oats
Hey Oaty
oatsArrive
just a man and his axe
dood imyt just tell it to stop
I've got 150 hours in this game and I still can't beat this guy off the bat
i fought once and left
not many people beat this guy under lvl 30
Low key you're doing better than I would
Ds2 is a bad representation of the series and combat

I told him that

But the dual wielding
atpQuan
No game has come close
@Tucculent art
Ya I didn't
thanks aniv
DS2 is an incredible art, like aniv said
what’s an “oats?”
I didn't want to waste my time since this game is the size of North America
atpRtsd
it became personal
Well then gl I believe
imyt can do it, he just needs to find a pattern he can utilize
we're in Delaware fighting a giant horse
vod viewers skip to the next vod pepeW
Cya oaty
believe? gamba? HUH
GAMBA
Hit boxes are pretty keen to the weapon
Naah there's RNG boss wise
I will say.. you will get to a point where you will dodge this 100%
That said, the terrain affects that
If he's above you, or below
your rolling into his halberd after he finishes his swing and hitting it at the end of your roll
you have 13 i frames
You can't fuck?
They have medicine for that
13 in 30fps logic

you are getting the hang of it
it is impossible to not be annoyed by this boss
pepeW
What Leo says
imagine if you had to fight two of these at one time. 😯
this guy just adapts too fast and making him your first boss is such bs lmao
bro got new moves
i don't think anyone is implying that you are performing poorly
yeah hes not doing bad, its just the game
quite the opposite, in fact
aniv say THANK YOU
refund the sub hes not thankful
I think imyt is doing pretty good, specially for a first time souls player
KEKW
Shame there isn't a IMNY left nut
most people that arent first time souls player dont even kill this boss
its not his first time though
he played ds2 with mkb
so it kinda is
damn
Trees and bushes are also a matter in this fight :D
physics dude
you will get it
just dont get hit and you wont need potions imytGrimace

nah you are, game is legit bs sometimes
It's ok Imyt, this game sometimes feels like when Ridley is doing random stuff
you're playing just as miyazaki intended

this game is like when oats kept getting that double dive from ridley in arcade

You need supers lol
yeah just 2

I think it feels the same, but slight differences in pathing and speed mean you end up on different terrain or he attacks slightly sooner
wheres varia dood
uh oh monkaS
he keeps the hp
dont worry

This one was under the belly
good attempt

AYO STAGGER POGGIES
STAGGER LETSGO
BONK
you skipped the tutorial?
that stagger was swagger
I'm not expecting anything, I'm here to watch you play the game at your own pace
i just take my time more when i die over and over but there is forsuree somejank with this game
this game has so many delayed attacks to punish panic rolling, it messes with your timing if you’re used to other action games
you dont get iframes for the ENTIRE roll
just the early part
just the start of the roll has the juicy iframes, I believe
as soon as you put your feet on the ground on the roll anymation, your iframes end
in for a penny
You got this, you had progresses so far
that side swing he does is probably his most random bs attack
there is logic to it he can figure it out
theres that too
I think there are some things you still dont know
yes
better dodge timing
do you really want the answer?
panic roll NotLikeThis
There's 66% <3 between Fusion Ship
what fps you rockin, 60?
well it aint 30
game locks at 60fps
Deadge
26 i frames then
he has lock on too
KEKW
LUL
is DS2 the one that put jump on l3?
you are doing pretty good
it takes awhile to learn the moveset
I know you might think that but you are figuring out a lot of things like time to hit time to dodge, when you can flask
yeah your doing good for no lvls
and this boss has like 1 billion moves
move timings can only really been solved via repetition, the reaction only gets you so far
I hope to see you play all the way through this game u definitely are capable there a lot of bosses that are just annoying
running far away is good usually safe
this boss was shocking to me because I was used to dark souls where they have like 3 moves
and this mother fucker is reading what I'm doing plus 26 different moves
you can't predict an enemy with 1 million moves that adapt to you to make it seem realistic
Yeah the move variety of bosses in Elden ring is crazy compared to dark souls
sick dodges holy
POGGIES 260 damage chain
IMYT NOOOO
this is the run!
But I also find it more engaging and rewarding when I end up getting it
must be a shockwave from the stomp?
oof that sucks
the "debris" its an AOE
good run
that was your best run I think
nah you entered flow state
Gotta roll right as it hits, while near the edge
you can jump over the shockwave takes a bit to adapt to the timing and movement
back to back runs
lookin good
you gotta treat this like kindom hearts if you ever played that
you look very close to me
id say the kingdom hearts 3 dlc is a good "practice" for this game
My understanding is this was put here to actually encourage players to leave and come back, in a normal souls game you gotta beat this guy to progress, but with open world you can leave things for later and explore
sure but instead of KH, you could play a good game KEKW
True. you need the Heartkeyblade for this
i think most people just skipped this fight first time around came back after leveling a bit
HE LEARNED IT POGGIES
that attack
YOU GUYS LIED TO HIM YOU CAN PARRY
HOLD
he cant parry this guy
HOLD
yes you can
parry stuns this guy
you can parry this huge ass guy?
imyt doesnt even have a parry
oatsGaming
That stuff meanwhile I can't even the thought you’d seen my message to test it
so it doesnt matter
NOOOOOOOOOO
only for side swings it seems
damn close good try
You have it
dude killer run
triUhh
close!
1 HP YEP
imyt perfect dodging everything and says its rng HUH
now its guaranteed he can do it this stream
VOD WATCHERS LOCK IN
@ShiroiTenshii right
the wiki has so many strategies for this guy hes so fucked
this dude has 1 gorillion moves KEKW
its based on where you are and what you are doing
does imyt have a skill or something that prevents 1 deathblow? HUH
Use code IMYT or follow the link https://madrinas.coffee/imyt to get 20% off your next Madrinas order! Slurp up dat coffee
yeah? so?
so... he does different attacks... and that's RNG?
fast fast
mid slow
That's cool
youDied
@ShiroiTenshii i think he's means it feels like RNG whether a hit registers or not? Shruge
i guess so
which is objectively false but.. Shruge
you mean like it isn't properly telegraphed?
yeah, thats what I said earlier, this boss was shocking because he has 1 billion moves, always changing and very smart ai
it’s more input reading to punish panic rolling which a lot of bosses have
like its a mixup
where dark souls they were like pretty dumb
and 3 moves
dejj
wrong flask equipped btw
you can unequip that flask btw
so it wont show up
elden ring makes dark souls look like a candy shop
dinner break NODDERS
You can just go progress and come back later
yea but now he has a vendetta
Because it's the Best
Maybe food and a breather will do you good
calebHeck
I need to level 1 this guy sometime
when he hits 50% he will always do that slam next

is lauren here?
I respect the dedication

axe finally broke?
HUH how is imyt pressing dpad?
I just started a new playthrough of this
barbWatch
@ShiroiTenshii he switched the binding so he wouldn't crouch on accident
thats only the up one for spells tho
My fingers are used to Zelda BOTW so I keep healing instead of attacking
just for up
that wouldnt do anything for weapon/item
i have a fxpak pro tomorrow I am staying home instead of teamates
monkaHmm Shruge
I'm close to finishing me Zweihander only playthrough. Just gotta clean up the final fight
Played any other souls games?
technically first one
technically yes, but essentially no
he played ds2 with mkb
oh jeez. That doesn't count
thats what everyone says

jesus, that scream
whats this weapon's art? L2
a weird swing

What's up with dpad up square flashing a lot?
@Heckran it's bound to L3
Ahh got it
instead of crouch, we set it to spells
cuz theres no intention of spells at this time
thats pretty good damage tbh
yis
dejj
because you are stubborn weebGiggles
I respect the commitment, I usually try optional bosses like 10 times before I give up and go elsewhere
only 10? HUH
I'm exactly like imyt
I saw this boss and spent my time here till I beat him
POGGIES
sick opener tho
I just wasnt so frustrated dying because dark souls series taught me that dying is part of the fun, as Miyazaki intended prayge
Miyazaki ReallyMad
i promise, deaths will still happen when you're "on level"
at least 1
less than this maybe
absolutely not
I dont think so
back from the CLUBS
i see the skill
out gettin SHITTY
this boss is probably 10x harder than anything you ever did in the whole of hollow knight
i think you underestimate the enemies/bosses in this game
no one thinks you are not skilled because of it
oh this boss? beat it at 5 years old blindfolded etc
I think lv 30 is still underleveled
WOAH
Imyt
this boss is probably lv 50-60

did you crank this to max difficulty or something?
he was my nemesis

@SpiffyThomas he is trying a lv 50 boss at lv 1
there is no "difficulty" setting
oh snap
so kinda turn it to max difficulty lol
this is at least possible tho
im surprised he can take a hit
that was a lore rock
george "ramps and rocks" martin put it there
Miyazaki put that rock there to fuck you

the jank is part of the appeal

you got this
nvm lol next time
real talk tho, do a dinner break

it is at that lvl cheese is king
you probably got lucky
@leotrinds SMILERS
he doesnt have the same attack pattern Shruge
your timing is not perfect
heavy attacks
enough heavy attacks
normal attacks dont stagger maybe? Shruge
Use code IMYT or follow the link https://madrinas.coffee/imyt to get 20% off your next Madrinas order! Slurp up dat coffee
jump attacks are considered heavy in this case
normal attacks can stagger but unlikely if only did it because stagger in this game is like a bar that goes up and slowly goes down if you dont keep hitting heavy attacks till the bar is full
bro charles beat this guy in ds2 at the beginning too so you have to do this
KEKW
he played ds2 and there was some giant thing
did you beat the giant at the beginning tho
nothing in dark souls 1, 2 and 3 come close to elden ring bosses
immediately open stream and I see you die KEKW
yea these delayed attacks are too much
did you end up beating oats in that one climbing game? I missed the ending of those streams
oats won the difficult game about climbing
nah oats lapped him
oh LMAO gg
oats didnt even do this guy

oh my bad sorry
so when do we ban IB pepeW

why isnt' death counter going up?
iirc he usually defaults to that low swoop attack if you put enough distance between you and him. can bait it out in the later phase maybe for more consistency.
That sucks
cuz its on the hundreds by now and he doesnt care KEKW
wrekt
it is easily in the 100+
counter is a meme anyway

i'm sorry man, that was a joke. youre doing great
I want you to do what is most fun for you
my bad.
If you're having fun im having fun
Shruge
I love challenges and I had fun fighting this boss even tho it was kicking my ass
fault was just memeing on the oats thing
Play how you want to play. I say that to anyone who plays this first time
fair enough. flat out, my bad. you're outplaying me by quite a bit

bro I literally gave up on Elden Ring after a few hours BibleThump it won
🐎
idk if i ever killed this guy
i def didnt finish this game
@HAM BibleThump
you should try again :(
i hope it wasnt cuz of this guy, HAM Sadge
that was wild
I honestly think if it weren't for the fact this arena is janky you'd find it a lot more predictable
the arena is the problem with this boss
on a flat surface the height of his halberd attacks wont change
Getting the boss or you caught on terrain, or having trees in the camera can really mess you up
is the L2 better than a heavy swing?
catThink
yea if you got time to commit l2 is better probably
I dont think it counts as heavy strike
that worked perfectly idkwym
ratGiggle
i usually try to go for jump attacks to get staggers, tho this guy runs away so it's not that easy to get lots of jump attacks on him >:(
accidental flask saved your life tho

it feels like drugs
GG
rush of dopamine
so......has imyt been on only tree sentinel the entire stream?
need more stats
my bad being demotivating before, here's for a real one
KEKPOINT
so you need to get to a specific grace to level
@faultfaultfault thank u for blessing me Prayge
I do think it's crazy that you get a weapon you need to level like 30 times to use
well gg's holy
gigl leo
@HAM you got it dude
imytMlady fragCorndog
shiroi
just saw the DM
all he had to do this whole time was jump
OMEGALOOL
OMEGALOOL
@daersora tbf it's tuned much more for the level you're "supposed" to kill tree sentinel at anyway
and dodge right on that huge swing he kept getting dragged to the left
not even willing to die for our entertainment
tho obviously they know most people will jsut obsessively mash their head against the wall at rl1 anyway
bro only voice
so theres a few important items in this area right?
like in the church
yeah
can't even level yet
ER having many good Hybrid Stat weapons is one of its best aspects.
church and need to go to grace north to get lv ups
https://clips.twitch.tv/TsundereEnchantingPastaBuddhaBar-ZdOOSMbIJtHn9kH7
i hope he doesn't die and lose all those runes before he can use them monkaS
imytEddieArrive lmao there's eddie and gar emotes in here?? imytGarGrab
he literally wont die anymore in this game
I am currently doing arcane faith build, for the obvious incants, having a lot of fun
after this painful training heh ad
LUL
faith build has been the most fun for me
is there a really cool scythe in this game?
faith dex faith strngth
it's all been good
winged? or angel? scythe
is fun
grave scythe has been my favorite
midgame tho
catThink
just looks cool
@imyt i was only in here for 15 minutes so from my perspective u nailed it pretty quickly KEKW
Feel better after that fight? Lol

yeah @ShiroiTenshii you can actually get winged scythe fairly early
Ignore the death counter
LOL
PauseChamp
i just saw the clip
What a dumbass
Lmao jk
i was getting ready for bed and you ALREADY BEAT IT
lest roll with this death counter don't even bother KEKW
get to counting IB, so the timeout coming back
frydiAYAYA bearbo1Hey bearbo1Lurk bearbo1Trip was my first playthrough today
or the timeout*
You killed the guy on the horse?
got a neat art, works with faith which lets you access the nice incants....pretty nice earyl game scythe all around
i was ready for another 2 hours at least and you already did it
oh right
ib
that's your job
Cheer150 Imyt, we're trying to get an accurate count of the amount of deaths in your run, however, we've already counted to infinity twice.
Yeah lol
what did you get for beating it
a huge weapon
wait so is he OP now
What you eating?
what u eating king
no
he cant equip it PepeLaugh
well, he can, but it'll deal peanuts damage
you can't equip weapons without certain levels
you should have gotten his horse instead angy

okay i'll count tomorrow bedge time
oh factor ran out
But you were playing the game imytCursed

Sounds good
I was up till you beat it

My friend wants to play with us if it's cool?
And what time do you want to play?
you guys gonna spread some DEMOCRACY?
Nah he's cool.
Maybe around 3-4 pm then?
Time to die more pepeW
just how it goes
BearBand
you spend runes to level up
a little later tho
Get used to this feeling. Spending 2 hours on one boss  imytBoyardee
has imyt played a souls before? I assume not with that reaction
you need a maiden to level
and you are infact maidenless
@ChiefKurtz technically yes, but it was DS2 on KBM, so we dont really count it
maidenless imytEddie
@chiefkurtz he's plays DS2
it opened the path behind it
ya those are consumables
That area is SICK
yea
it's like alttpr retro keys basically
imytGross
so uhh sometimes the game mechanic is to just be poisoned
it's so VILE that this is the first stonesword key place they show you, on god
just book it
i would go get a maiden first cuz of your runes
yeah spend the boss runes before you lose em
yea go find your maiden first
lower right corner
they show bottom right

what do you need to use the halberd?
Press the share button
For help
yeah what he said
Str faith and some dex iirc?
@McDonkaDonk20 pepeL how are you jorp
so weapons have a damage scaling, some are based on str, some dex, etc.. otherwise vigor for HP and endurance for more equipment carry weight
The share button should give you explanation of every stat
Cooking
if you want to go for daggers i'd say dex is the way to go
level up costs are strictly based on level and not the stat
I would use the rest of your runes
hold triangle for the sub menu
sub menu op
Hold triangle and r1 for 2h
then you need to equip it
pause menu and right side to equip
pause and move to right side of pause menu
Press start for menu, look right side and edit pouch

Yeah that's valid
if ur talking about the horse guy at the start hes just a troll
you can do it! you beat treesentinel at level 7 you can do anything
no he means some skeletons outside this dungeon tig
Check that helm
There is no "right" way to play.  You can beat any encounter at level 1.  Elden Ring, and all souks games, rewards preparation and knowledge.  Until you learn. And souls games will force you to learn.
It adds either Dex or strength
oh the goop enemies have high phys resistance
running straight to the boss is a goated strat when you know the way
surely those guys wont be a problem later UNAWARE

Slimes are strong to slash.  And weak to bludgeoning
they are weak to fire
Double tap them
Open your map pls
skeletons respawn if you don't hit them while they're reviving
Can't open map when enemies aggroed
You can jump super high on torrent in that wind

you cant be staggered i think
you can always die

You have to be in radius of the state of marika
Horse dude didn't need one and you 9ne shot the boss in the cave
it’s only in certain areas, it’s to make runbacks not so tedious
they put those stakes so you dont have to do a lot of run backs like the other games
stake of marika is a checkpoint basically
but not a grace

They did pick the most difficult areas to not put a stake of Marika.  Even then it isn't bad

tbf I got frustrated many times
I ended up cheating in a couple ways because I don't like banging my head against a wall until it works
Losing runes is just part of the game Shruge
Its a fromsoft game, its meant to be jank and frustrating

that thing must sting.
stink
zoopy and ryu you have to flip
Pretty damn good first attempt
I was going to scream if you got that first try
tbh
Heads || You lose!
do that
crap I’m missing the reaction bc ads lemme sub real quick
you so got this dude i think hes easier than big dumb knight at the beginning of the game
Is your body reggie?
He is definitely easier than tree sentinel
sorry was subbing.
Heads
so everyone in here question what the most runes u have lost in this game mine is 3.4mill
Oh damn, why did you have so many runes on you?? I think like maybe 70k in one hit for me
You have to do !flip heads or tails
i think it lost 1.5mil when i died lategame after reaching the highest level i wanted to go
Tails || You lose!
heh
I definitely lost more than 3 million
ryu still didnt flip
I just wanted to waste points
I don't know what to do
it was a i loaded my guy up after not playing for awhile and for got i had crap ton of runes and got pooped on
do this ry
Heads || You win!
or tails
say either !flip heads or !flip tails
just do that
Heads || You lose!
damn
Sadge
thanks leo
i dont wanna move this one on my homies hate ceres
my points I feel sick
Haha always go heads :P
Heads || You win!
4 month sub anniversary:(
You can spawn it out of the fog
lies of p puts your souls outside the fog gate, was a nice change  to the genre
Kinda
2000k is a good ammount but usually I just wander around the fight till I eventually am close to my runes
2000, not 2000k
KEKW
so anyway, I def lost more than 3 million because I used to just leave a summon sign close to M____ia boss battle and help people
@zoopygoo you may need to refresh the stream page if you just subbed, sometimes twitch will still give you ads until you refresh, just so you dont miss anything in the future
and one day I lost all of what I had gathered there
45 degree angle upper left dodges around his hitbox saves time and keeps you outta the way
zoopy dont teach him
heh
he is a big boi he is learning
I really enjoy this boss, really good learning moment for the rhythm of dodges and hits
yeah this is the true tutorial boss
it’s like a fighting game and the combo is back, up-left, up-left, back
no whine? Widege
Cheer150 put these foolish ambitions to rest.
Picking up runes should always be a secondary concern, fight the boss and if you end up near runes pick them up
your thoughts are wrong YEP
low key agree with strimmer Susge
maaaaan didn't even beat margit first try
jk he's actually a decent roadblock lol don't ban
I think we're at 6 or 7 deaths now? I know we took the death counter off screen
This game has tons of delayed animations and it can get pretty frustrating to have to wait forever to dodge
the combat is about finding openings
I always ignore my dropped runes, I try to level up or spend on things in shops so I never have enough to worry about losing them
it punishes you for going all in
I wouldn't worry about getting your souls after death. You can farm them back really fast
It punishes you for going all in *if you don't know all the timings and patterns*
Which of course you won't know first playthrough
dont worry about 2k runes
its really nothing
@leotrinds Yup
It makes it harder to focus on the fight if you're constantly focused on getting your runes
but it is up to you
Cosplaying Vlad with the blood magic
Did you have that sort of feeling with NKG in hollow knight? Because that was another fight where you would only attack after 1 or 2 attacks you felt confident in getting hits safely
He can't fall off
Sadge
is this just a git gud game I take it?
YEP
It isn't that difficult early on
Promise there's much much harder later
oh really
this looks worse
so hollow knight
interesting
you can make a lot in this game too it is just harder to find the openings
this looks super intense
these mechanics are what make the game interesting for most
PepeLaugh maybe imyt
try
I think if I was playing this whole drinking madrinas I'd have an actual heart attack
while*
Without spoiling too much, I wonder if you'd like one one of the souls game which encourages and rewards aggressive play.
To be fair you are using a dagger, and levels matter, and stamina management is important
well you weapon relies on bleed so you wont do much damage with the hits
sleeping only that needs FCR
Honestly super excited for the DLC
Hope they have a fight on the level of the one fight that should not be named
PausersHype dlc
PausersHype
@Gameaholic2D which one are you thinking of? I haven't played outside of Dark souls and elden ring but I know bloodborne rewards agression a lot
@AsheWynLucatiel cant wait to imyt fight that boss and say nooo disagreee no way duuuude
LMAO
@daersora BB is the one
Sadly I am PC only so no BB for me, but really interested in trying it one day
BB felt odd for my dark souls brain
BB > ER > Sekiro > DS3 > 2 = 1
Oh nice Elden Ring let's gooo
Imo
Can't wait for the DLC
@AsheWynLucatiel 2 = 1?
No, it just does less damage
peepoLeaveFinger
povert2Gachi
No it doesn't suck, it gives more opportunity to damage than heavier weapons
but does less per hit
I'm not sure if I want to try sekiro or DS2 next, but definitely keen to give them both a shot
I didnt like sekiro
HUH leo
WHAT
Smadge
I just didnt
That's fair
I felt like it was a great game
I feel like I would enjoy sekiro, the back and forth parrying and such seems fun
but not for me
True, you don't take an hr off<2
@daersora you should look into Lies of P if you're into that style
sekiro is fun
it’s like rock paper scissors
Will do, there's just so many games and not enough time in my day
ER is the faster paced game based off reactions of the series
ER is the fastes by far
BB is faster bro
thats not souls
ER is close
Madge
HUH
how is this souls but BB isn't
you gotta admit
this is much more like dark souls than BB
ER is definitely faster than any of the DS for sure
I guess Sekiro is even faster anyway lol
sekiro was really fast
I don't gotta admit shit
This is definitely the most Soulsy non-souls fromsoft game
despite knowing that yeah it is closer
but it isnt much of a souls game either
its not even rpg
It's an open world ARPG what you mean
@AsheWynLucatiel KEKW
yo imyt, nice work on the tree sentinel. you did it SeemsGood
@AsheWynLucatiel WHAT there are not even levels and and
HUH
NOT EVEN LEVELS????
???????
It is yes imyt don't worry
?????????????
Me watching chat PopCorn
There's levels in literally all of these
Levels as in coherently designed areas of the game I think?
sekiro is more of a skill tree thingy
you dont have like lv 57
Wait oh you're talking about sekiro still leo lmao
sorry
yeah

At least I get to mix up my incants for variety
you can set any l2 you want
This weapon no
if you find the weapon arts
oh, not this weapon?
ok
I thought you could change anything
Nah, some weapons have locked in unique ashes
Generally if it uses somber to upgrade it's locked in
Shruge I wouldnt
KEKW
the bosses in this game have a shit-ton of moves too, and they keep adapting to what you are doing
I think heavy attack with daggers is counter to the point of a dagger
a lot of trail and error yep
so you could beat it, but you prefer to make us watch you die a million times?
you got this!!
fuck so close
I jinxed it
honestly hardest boss in the game
Yeah kinda rough cause you are forced to face him I guess. I forget how much you can do before fighting him
btw you can critical staggered bosses, if you position yourself right in front of them and r1, just like regular enemies you will do one of those critical moves, they probably didnt make this very clear in the tutorial
@d1gitaldave literally most of the game
oh lol
basically everything except the endgame areas is accessible at all times if you know the paths and whatnot
It's been too long since I played this so I couldn't remember.
so you a dex player huh SusgeHammer
tho tbf, the way around this castle is not immediately obvious if you aren't exploring a ton
Yeah I remember going around, I was just thinking that was to avoid the later area boss and not Margit. Couldn't remember though.
wrong flask is going to get him killed
you cooked
Does imyt have any mana flasks?
no
He shoulds unequip them then

One more super trivia game coming up!
pshh I knew that one
@leotrinds LUL
🍍 EVERYONE can play, !superanswer in 45s for 20 cuteness — category is LIVIN' LA VIDA LOBSTER — One of a lobstering crew is called this man, not because he's grim but for standing in the back of the boat
ikr aniv
Damn aniv
🍍 Sorry everyone, y'all are out of time… 🥲 … The correct answer is: a stern man
pshh I knew that one
Boss who should not be named...
Shit I wonder who that is...
And I can't get a name. T_T
M_
Oh yeah.
Love. For sure.
its very fast YEP
and doesnt keep you waiting at all YEP
I'm not talking about this boss
I know.
altho tbf
I'm telling imyt KEKW he thought I was talking about this boss
Ooooh. =)
asking for bosses to do things after they space away is just inviting future NIHIL pain
Yeah he gets faster after a third HP, lol.
finding all sorts of place you can hit him
;)
ouch, so close
I forget what weapon(s) I used early on
so close last fight
you'll get bleed. Just keep fighting him as if you had no bleed and you'll get it
his combo attacks are nuts
it's realy hard not to roll a lot yeah
I struggled with a that a ton learning dark souls games
with ER it's really important to press with intention tbh. I had the same habit and this game is what killed my spamming habit forever hah
yeesh
ouch
timing heals is also very difficult
thought you would get that roll too
lol
HUH i see mod logs in my chat area beside settings... am i a mod?
NOPERS analog
but 7tv shows some stuff
7tv or other similar plugins sometimes show it to you
oh, that might be what it is hahaha
cause i installed 7tv a couple days ago
analog doing the look at me I'm the mod now
hahaha :P
oh weird
Modge
that 3 swing attack he does is brutal
bye tree haha
Margit the Tree Feller
hahahaha
swinging a full on tree at you
I tend to always roll in to the boss, since the hitbox on their attack is usually away from them
OK time to board plane. GL imyt hope you beat him soon!
have a safe flight Lava!
16 hour flight 🫠
hows this game treating you dood
youre kinda right yeah
each enemy has a robustness level, and you have to do enough bleed damage to reach that level before it procs
then it goes up and gets harder to bleed after that
I mean, overall, I do agree a lot of ER bosses aren't hard, but I am confused as to why you say a boss liek this isn't skillful
hes baiting you
no
i mean the boss is
Use code IMYT or follow the link https://madrinas.coffee/imyt to get 20% off your next Madrinas order! Slurp up dat coffee
i mean hes trying to bait you but youre not falling for it causing it to be more slow
well if its boring why play it
I mean, I'm confused how that isn't skillful tho? If you really did wait that much....you still have to successfully dodge all the attacks between the "free hit" one
noooo
yo imyt, did you just play a game of League? Because I just got done playing with a Swain GOD.
you can do that on every boss on every game
By cheese it seems you mean just learning the openings in each attack
I mean, I'd disagree with that.  That's just the safe/consistent way. There's ways to make every attack an opening, even on this boss
^
but even so, I'd still be confused if it was genuinely only those two attacks that you could safely attack on....how is doing that "cheese" to begin with
on the same coin. If you only attacked when you needed to, you'd save a lot of time fighting him once instead of like 30 times LUL
it's long drawn out animations yeah
Wow, that stab move he does wrecks you haha
sick dodges dood
some of the attacks do have very specific responses to be aggressive tho ya, and there's no one universal answer
There's a big part of me that feels like you're used to 2d games where there's a certain limit to the variability in how animations can interact? So it's more predicatable and easier to find openings
Deadge
also, learning just how much of your kit they intend jumping to be in this game transforms the game wildly imo
dagger jump attack is not the best, but just jumping instead of rolling as a dodge option
get em imyt
It's kind of crazy seeing the flow charts for bosses in this game, seeing how their attacks can potentially chain based on what you do, it's very big variance in their patterns
margit isn't necessarily the best example tho
sick backstab
jumping instead of rolling was literally the answer for the shield jumps of tree sentinel that he shakes the ground
@daersora it's pretty polarizing in my experinece, and ususally contributes to whether people like this or other soulsbornes more
I do that caterpillar room
wow aniv
show me next time
I personally prefer this instead of the simpler flowcharts
honestly, you are doing much better than a lot of people (including me) who are on this boss at this point in the game
imyts in flow state rn
@ChiefKurtz Definitely something I enjoy, because it means I think a lot more on my feet and have to adapt more (my own feelings not a judgement on any one elses opinion))
I hate that combo....7 delayed/slow attacks in a row
cookin
here we go
wwwww
kill em
NOOOOO
awe damn!
nice cookage
altho tbh some of the heal punishes definitely got a little rage out of me later in the game
imytNodders
@ChiefKurtz Madge
SCAMMED
wanna see a picture of its attack pattern once you defeat it?
@chiefkurtz Like in GodSkin Duo ? LUL
@ChiefKurtz I haven't beat the two optional endgame rune bearers because I hate their movesets, I don't find them fun
HeyGuys
he's got hella reach
@EternalQc well, GSD I feel is easier to punish / bait. It's really exploitable. More other bosses tbh
1st fight against Crucible Knight punish a lot too
side note: the ability on your weapon adds to bleed meter WAY more than normal hits. Might be worth allocating one flask to fp regeneration
Double light sword into stab? Yeah it sucks
@daersora dude, people sing the praises of waterfowl lady as one of the hardest / most fun bosses in ER but she's so bleh/easy/mediocre outside of THE ATTACK
@ChiefKurtz truuuuuuuuuuu
Yeah she doesn't seem to overturned aside from the one move, but it just turns me off the fight so much
I'd say the rest of her kit is wildly undertuned in comparison, especially her p2 special attacks
the thing that annoys me a lot is the 'large aoe around the character' attacks that are just there to compensate for the fact the boss leaves itself open from behind lol
@ChiefKurtz Yeah, heck the hand of Madrinas bish
like it's wild that there was just a time she DIDNT do THE ATTACK at all, and I just won for free because the rest of her was that easy
learning that attack was really satisfying tho
every attack is dodgeable, its just timing
@Etuca ya, that was my biggest complaint with this game. Some attacks were just "gtfo and don't play the game for a sec"
yeah it's bit random
seeing the flow chart for the attacks for this guy is insane to try to read
the flow chart / adaptation is actually also why I love Pale Court mod for HK so much too.  Dryya and Ze'mer are SO fun and incorporate that too
its gonna be something like: 7 normal hits for bleed proc, then 8, then 14, then 21. Unless you are using the reduvia blood blade ability too.
@Obedmaziah saying a brand name makes me realise I haven't seen a good cerveza cristal meme in ER yet
youDied
Sadge
oatsPrayge PotFriend
Yeah, I feel there are only a couple of attacks that he can't follow up on with the fast dagger
this makes me want to finish my coop run finally
That attack seems incredibly hard to dodge
imytPrayge
Where he jabs you with his tree haha
weapons are pretty balanced in this game, aside from a few that are just ridiculously good at staggering
I cheesed this fight by doing mroe stuff first haha
remember when bosses could kill themselves off a map?
Oldge
@Tucculent Taurus demon?
@d1gitaldave this is not cheese this is the way the game expects you to do this, there is a bunch of thing outside of the castle
Pepperidge farm remembers
+ its an rpg so leveling up is also not cheese YEP
oh yeah I think I had the one frost axe or something that was powerful
im guessing this boss benefits from fast rolls? for them up close combos?
what sword is that?
oh nvm
yo brother! i hope you are having fun with the run so far
Are you doing a no-summon run ?
The ability is solid
even npcs?
I used summons haha, I guess that's more of the cheese
how long we been fighting margit?
im doing my best with the flex
Man I wish you could cut off margits tail as a weapon, I miss tail weapons
thanks aniv
may I offer a piece of wisdom?
nah, margit is a huge roadblock for first playthrough
this is pretty much the level they intend you to fight margit at
Yea, cause some ppl accept NPC sum in their runs, and there is on right at the entrance
i have been there my man
@ShiroiTenshii 1h40 but there's been breaks
NODDERS
@ChiefKurtz Kinda sorta
i think this is it
imytSleeper
these mid rolls are fun
wait are these mid
I'm mid... Sadge
oatsSoundasleep
yeah it looks mid
this boss is kinda a dick
can you run a shield on dagger?
or are you shieldless
it is possible yues
you could go in more at first maybe?
then saved ranged for 2nd phase
try getting a mana flask. Blood blade does work
Shield parry works good on him
but parry Saddies
nice dodge
Shield doesn't block all damage on his lighting weapon attacks
But it does help
who cares about blocking
we want parry
@Tucculent TRUE

@Eddie Did you do that
the table is the grace
@Eddie Did you do that
he keeps breaking shit
arc is bleed yeah
@Eddie Did you do that
hp is really good
@Eddie Did you do that
I dont think you can rank up bleed
you can use runes from your inventory
or sell them
selling stuff? NoThanks
arcane means magic
you had small runes that give you runes
ideally now you wanna find another dagger and put a bleed ash of war on it
yo its him
Arcane means a few things but magic is not one of them
Don't lie to the man
roflmao late GG's for the boss imyt, i was hella distracted haha
was i lied to by other media then
@imyt "equip load" is also important when picking gear, it changes your dodge roll
honestly aside from overall rough armor class and most importantly, load category....I just equip what looks good. Most gear doesn't really impact gameplay aside from equip load
he mid rolling
dodge roll is based on current load as a % of your max
remove your shield if you dont use it
under equip load youll see med load which tells you what roll youll get out of it
medium roll for now
right side
on the right
right udner hte numbers
30% equip load is light
that mask is heavy AF
that big ass helmet
you need to be under 15.9
damn
15.9
what they said
you can raise the amount by leveling stamina
you can also get more endurance (?) to increase max load
it's hard to get to light without having a way higher overall equip load which is rough early since spending on endurance feels bad
ok stamina
is stamina here?
That's Lost Count number 5

poise = your stagger meter
I felt bad when I figured out what this did lol
it removes the debuff she gave you
if you hold onto that item your max health goes down
I played through a huge chunk of the game with it...
ur good now
become oldge for how long it takes to beat bs bosses
she gave you a hug imyt
id say that outways everything
never trust anyone giving out free hugs haha
i mean you got a hug
positive if you like hugs and poise

theres literally magic you can hit even farther away from lmao
I see
Ranged tends to have an animation length trade
sick
yoo its her
doo it
I feel like imyt will not use this feature though
Marry her
I don't think I ever used ranged in this game, nor magic really. I did use summons tho
summoning
I've never understood why people like this chick
haha
it's a lady, and people are deprived
I like her because spoiler reasons
queen!
shes so cute
yo is that santa
@ShiroiTenshii fair
her quest line stuff is my fave parts of the game
I'd say my favorite maiden in the game is PATCHES
That noise is people being crucified I think
haha
patches
LUL
the ranged attack builds bleed way faster than normal attacks
mayor mccheesing
I forget the damage type. Blood?
Imyt attacking innocent wildlife
when did this get added lol i swear i dont remember this
They require mana to use
you need to equip it and the bell
equip same screen as your flask
you can only use it in certain places, and you need mana
out of mana
the little grave icon on the left means that you can summon
theyre not even aggro
are they
oh they are
its like the name of ketchup on well done
On the equipment page, there are 10 slots down the bottom you can set to your flask button
aniv, dont even go there
dood those are just babies
By default your flasks are set,but you can set consumables, ashes, as well
Boc is on the coast, out west
who is bro?
yes
Yep
the tailor guy?
He said he was going to the cave on the coast
ah kk yeah thats in the south
It took me SO long to realise you could go to the coast my first paythrough
is the coast here?
Space ghost coast to coast
they aren't bad to grind for some exp
If I recall heh
You can roll over those skulls, can be easier
free cam is the elite way to play, lock on is noob bait ratirlBrain
I literally never locked on except when on torrent in my playthroigh
So much more precision of movement and attacking
im exaggerating a bit LUL
Use code IMYT or follow the link https://madrinas.coffee/imyt to get 20% off your next Madrinas order! Slurp up dat coffee
I always locked on D:
almost
Plus the camera souls is real with some of the crazier bosses like tree spirits
OOOO
imytNodders
Not the reduvia 💀
ez
no, easily best weapon in game
Bleed op
have you played with the parry?
especially at this point
Any weapon is good if you commit
invisible bridge dood
best for bleed playstyle yeah
One of the best bleed weapons yes
its like one of 4-5 weapons people no hit the game with
isn't there OP bleed sword also, I forget
It’s considered very high tier because bleed in insane in this game and it’s a somber weapon with bleed stacking weapon art
@d1gitaldave probly rivers of blood
beach ball
hahaha, bye soccer ball
guraWave bye bye glowy skull
use your firsts dood
Plus ranged attack is good for some bosses
Come here to cross to be in a relationship end? like 6 months later and people with that
i think you set out to find a cave on the coast
damn aniv
ROB got kinda nerfed the best bleed weapon these days is elonoras twinblade for sure
you beat WHO??? HUH
please dont beat torrent :0(
wow, the kraken looks kinda... uhhh... yeah...
Love collecting octopus ovaries
Yeah having at least one ranged ability is useful
I ended up using the golden halberd most of the game haha. It was pretty OP on horseback
ovaries? HUH why
the only thing weird about the dagger, is the dmg is based on a weird stat you may not realize in casual
Golden halberd is so ridiculous for poise breaks
its okay to die :D it happens lots in game
might want to find a torch
That's your guy
thats him
Its ya boy Boc
He is beautiful
when he finds out
lol
HAHAHA
ROFLMAO
LOL
KEKW
you got cheesed
lol when it goes from bad to worse
BeeArrive
btw the guy at the church sells a torch, for these dark caves
omg so many bloodstains
to think this boss fight is such a early barrier
lol ya right he says to his cowering enemies
HUH
shippe wreck'd
Yep spells
dragon spellz
You do a big chomp
summons a dragon head to do a big chomp
yin and yang symbol

holy crap
HECOOKED
good thing bleed is %
nope stake right there
Yeah that's a later area
No, no run
marika's stake
stake
Stake brings you to the boss room
marika always better
Stake should be close
Marika if you want to fight the boss again
does it bleed? HUH
this thing looks cool
does it bleed... sap? KEKL
This looks like a Resident Evil boss
it does bleed POGGIES
I definitely don't like this arena for the fight, half the body is clipped through the wall and you can't see what's happening
if u look by ur health u will see a small stake icon means you are near a stake
I hate these floppy wall clipping headed monsters.
mmmmm steak
Piggleton what are you doing here

7tv is the best addon ive added in a long time haha
AAAA

lockon not req
I think it was on the side of his head
you kinda went to the front of his face, its on the side
Nicee
woooooooooo
POGGIES
Yeah nice
-flop flop flop-
putted out their eyeses precious
punch it in the jimmy
Hmm
Not really
Nope
bleed seems more efficient than the crit
bleed is better anyway?
dagger no stagger
no but when bleed procs do a % of his hp
aaaaa
You could one hand the sword and use dagger as well
aaaaa
oh you can sword right hand and dagger left, and 2h the sword for a stagger or something
i couldnt even imagine someone doing this game hitless...
Ofc it's not all bosses hitless
cripes
Just a matter of learning the moveset
@analog56x look up ginomachino he does hitless runs
Hob also did Ds1, Ds2, Ds3, Elden Ring, Sekiro and Bloodborne hitless back to back, like Gino
thats insane...
@LayrusQuin thats dope
yeah
Ye it is :D
Uhmm kinda of?
Yeah almost every boss can stagger
Yeah it's a crazy one
Your choice imho
If you want to fight it I want to watch
if youre not having fun, leave

Oh man i opened that like 1 hour into the game
this area is scary early
Oh boy...
glhf man

i hate rats, but thats because they kill our chickens... so its a personal thing for me haha
I hate this place with a burning passion
imyt used sneak: its highly effective!
HUH
imytDeadies imytDeadies imytDeadies imytDeadies imytDeadies
this area is... tough let's just say that
your best bet is to just RUN out of here KEKW
ITS A SUPER SHRIMP MAN
totally looks like a decrepit shrimp KEKL
he did but you just didn't see it
KEKW
he's on the roof i think haha
his shrimpy senses are tingling
pests are so fun
Oh nonononono
Not this place I have flashbacks
BabyRage
I accidentally came here super early from the trap. I just ran
well, methinks its sleep time imyt. have a great rest of your stream! cya later everyone! y'all have a wonderful sleep!
I fell in here like hour 1 into my first play through. Was rough
DIESOFBEDGE
I wasn't pretty leveled either
Sellia is a scammy place
that hard part is the number of them
shrimp city
homing missiles spell
you can always circle around back for the backstab crit on these slow guys
1x lv 4
It's the quality
Can't wait for the DLC, so I can die in 1k different ways more
those guys take damage to strike mainly
cant put it on a unique weapon
I think you have to put it in an item use slot?
Consumable
kick down the ladder for a shortcut
ye
if you die
ye
when
Yeah lots of stones here
Right
nah stuck til you find the grace
You can't because you are in a legacy dungeon
You either beat the boss or find a way out
gotta beat the mine boss to get teleporting rights
or you can just leave, but you have to find the way out
This place was invasion central month 1 of the game also KEKW
you have your shortcut the other direction, up the hill
the ladder
no lol

i mean it's recommended for later game, that trap just fucks you over,
Oh so the chest brought us here LUL
you could probably ranged attack one and draw him away for single combat
Imyt why is your character looking like lethargic kratos
There's ways you have to play with dagger
I dont believe so
oh you can
nice
look at best by at least
no its open now
also this is the end of the mine, you can always find the way out
did you get tricked by the treasure chest?
it's rude either way
you can teleport now
have to find grace outside
this area is rough
you can travel now I guess
roundtable hold dagger at vendor i think
there is one for sale there
left by an NPC
it's an npc message
burger king wizards
This is basically how I did my first playthrough, ended up in the cave and was too stubborn to leave the high level area
they let you summon in friends
coop
you passed the shack
stop by the shack tigeltT
yeah its here. The weird lady sells a bunch of gear
that person is long dead....
you need somber smithing stone 1
you got lv 4 ones, you need a lv 1
haha
you can add bleed later
but you get dual wield at least
Can it parry tho?
you can actually upgrade that dagger too with the smithingstones you've got
yeah make sure to put it in left hand
put it in left hand
eqip it to your off hand
Other row
down
4Head
Shield row
"bottom" hand
Then push left
now L1 does dual wield attacks
The bloodstained dagger is what your looking for it is a random drop from an enemy is the South West
jump L1s are good too
he's unlocked the ability to play daggers Pog
it has jump attacks and run attacks too
No more South, map is big lol
Yeah L1 is moveset
south is pretty mild, relatively
imyt teaching us Prayge
you were in the lake when you got teleported
pretty sure
Yeah the regular dagger doesn't have bleed I don't think so it's a little slower buildup
I'm off to bed, happy travels
there is a castle to the south that has a bleed art of war. would add bleed to the dagger
the nice thing about that is you can always remove it and use it on a better one later
find a bridge
It's all about exploring. Sometimes you'll beat a dungeon for a POS shield, other times you'll find an OP weapon behind a tree out in the open
i think you can make that
EZ
lol
watch your step
Kappa
some of the merchents sell lanterns
this cave is more the correct level
"Do you serve picked turtle neck here?"
this cave is a cake walk compared to the one you got teleported to
cute rat :)
ratJAM ratJAM ratJAM ratJAM
RATSLIDE RATSLIDE RATSLIDE RATSLIDE
yeah once you have bleed on the second one it will be a lot better
ah the mighty rat
ratJAMGutters Come fight us nerd
even better buys twitch to delete the bots are spiders for statistics websites
Torch in first shop if you want one
you can also buy a latern that just equips like lies of p
if you want to see
oh lol
ratJAMGutters You win this time
otherwise stay in darkness
inc your most favorite model
Runebear is nasty actually
i hate this guy
ratJAMGutters Welcome back
bears are aggro as F in this game
yarrRage GETTEM BEAR BRO
dual wielding feels like more dmg, but until you get another bleed weapon, solo dagger is your highest dps

nice

nice job man, you clearing through this game
increasing faith dmg spells
faith = incantations
Imyt you can equip both
you have two slots
he's technically just a normal enemy with a boss healthbar
I think the rune bears outside are even harder as normal mobs lol
Clap Talisman is good tho, all magic defense
what is a dub?
it lead you to the cave
lol never heard of that
they will lead you to secrets
So there's a wooden bridge nearby with the creature that has that dagger
You were right there
Ight
it's a very nice tree idd
ppFall peepoSad
grace at the church on that hill. that way you can farm easier
ohhh flask upgrade nice
now just a matter of getting lucky for him to drop it
yeah you can tp
Yeah, I don't think this guy bleeds
do it tryndamere
chop him up
yea that kinda felt like underfed pyke hits
Yeah attacks really awkwardly delayed
fire thingy on your sword might work on him
happens lol we all been there
getting closer
sounds like liars, its bad int his game but not the worst case
yeah i did a 2hand greatsword playthrough and sometimes id have buffers inputted from my great great grandfather come out
i hear you, im not a huge ER fan
I mean, I rated it 4/10. I get it.
honestly your path is pretty wild so its interesting to see lol
^
still live? PauseChamp
Wait how did that not hit
KEKW
@SmellyPolar hiii
blushcat hi aniv
yeah thats pretty much the end boss of that area
all you can do is run
so on that one attack, you can hold circle and run, the dodge will still get you hit sometimes
there's a tech that kinda trivializes the beams
did you end up killing Tree Sentinel without any progression?
ok gamer
thats sick though
Holy crap imyt is still going, dude you need to sleep at some point
Almost 11 hours and it's not even a scamathon
:)
skill issue
<3
there is a mod that unlocks the framerate, I wonder if that would help with the inputs being so bad
dark souls punishes paniced actions
lol
Use code IMYT or follow the link https://madrinas.coffee/imyt to get 20% off your next Madrinas order! Slurp up dat coffee
think u ran out of stam or it was a little tree
GG
omg if u died there
gj
first try LETSGO
nice nice gg
its okay, thats the last time you will see that boss
you'll get used to it
I got no problem with the inputs when I play
It's hard to get use to
once you commit to an action you're locked in - especially if stamina is low
Think running out of stamina might be a factor
i guess paniced is wrong term, i should have said extra inputs
the developers just want very calm measured play
That guy you killed has the dagger
all i saw from tree boss was greed hits
the last attempt was pretty much perfect
ya, you said you clicked the run button during the atk and the input would get eaten
i cant really see that from my end tbh
yeah i wasnt watching inputs, or stamina, or any trees in the way
honestly all we can really see is if you attack when you shouldnt, the rest we can just go off what you're telling us
i can see it being an annoying mechanic
yeah thats definitely a thing in this game lol
i dont think that guy drops anything
jump down and see trust me bro
Kappa
@Nevdi LUL
is dragons lair perfect
@ObviouslyNerd he has drops
i think coming off of hollow knight, this mechanic is very annoying
ok i wanna sit here and rant with u but i gotta go eat food
you'll be gone when i get back Sadge
because hollow knight allows you to dodge whenever
LOL
this is a perfect game too
HK baby game
wow Etuca
HK is true platformer and responds well
this is by far the easiest dark souls, especilaly if you use summons
sekiro is probably the best dark souls
either this or DS3 is easiest
@ObviouslyNerd Sekiro not a Souls Game and Myazaki said that himself
the build in this game impacts the difficulty a fair bit
dark souls 2 is super hard if you arent a careful player, tons of ambushes
but its also very safe and slow for bow players
and the bosses are pretty 1 dimensional
i try to recommend people dont force the difficulty in this just for the sake of it
the game has a sick atmosphere, cool stuff happens, just do what you like
you 100% sure he drops a dagger?
What up lol
Very low drop
Took me about 50ish times
the shade
There's a grace site if you keep going around that cliff
there's a silver foot consumable that can boost item drop chance, you can craft it unless you need a cooking book for it
Other way
Yeah
you could also go on the Elden Ring Social club and ask for a dagger for trade
I've been letting you explore o
Lol
oh he drops drop it at 5%
it's 5 am here imytFade
oh yeah!!!!!!
PogChamp
thats sick now you have dual wield bleed
lets go
nice
you can change scaling with certain ashes of war
you are going to eat bosses now
You have to use an ash of war to make it scale with sex
bleedi s controlled by arcane
Dex opps
arcane only affects bleed if the weapon scales with arcane
need 4 smithing stone 1
Go to a grace and select ash of war
Use that
Only one you have but you can change them whenever
you can change the scaling
Go quality
@iphaedos thats true for the weapons dmg, but not for the rate of bleed build up
quality is balanced scaling of str + dex
Later on you can get better whetstones and scale it with arc
You can remove it whenever
@ObviouslyNerd hmm interesting. This games mechanics are so hard to remember
KEKW
holy fuck your still going
24 hour stream WickedNodders
CATBEDOINGTHELAUNDRY
either that or vigor imo. but if you don't plan on getting hit you don't need vigor LUL
well you are attacking like 14 times
Veigar? ratGiggle
so you wanna no hit late game bosses, will be fun to watch
you say that now.
eventually everything in the game will one shot LUL
🤏 SMILERS
it's not about the size of the healthbar it's about how you use it

Different enemies have different bleed resist
NotLikeThis
Wow, Imyt Ring time? I thought it would never arrive! Good luck and have fun!
I remember Limgrave
Explore dood
It's a big map
he does own
It's funny how big the map is compared to what you've been to hehe
this is like tears of the kingdom hard mode lol
Imyt wants to touch grace? Wow, Imyt not a gamer confirmed, next you'll say he's maidenless LUL
there’s a korok up there somewhere KEKW
Hello Imyt and friends bongoWave
scary lol
it’s like “it’s ok man I’m touching grass that’s all”
man i've missed a lot of your playthrough :(.  How you enjoying the game so far though? How long did the first boss take?
Where is a little horn that goes AHHHHOOOOOGA when you need it?
seems like its going well rofl
that sword should be illegal
If it's the same that Charles deals with in souls 2 then yeah it probably is bad
what is the over/under death count for this play through?
I rarely ever lock on unless the camera is being ridiculous
omg dont skip me
Lmao
@SmellyPolar Get on ghost strafe?
HOW DO YOU LIKE ELDEN RING
this game is hard, but it’s fun
Roooooooofl wow you beat him immediately, thats very imty
the “welcome to Elden Ring” encounter
imyt*
imyt, that’s commendable though
i love this game so much. i am jealous you are playing through it for the first time
yeah its like...one of the few single player games i've ever really enjoyed
I actually adore this game
I was pumped to see you play it
you hyped for the dlc bonk
hahaha yeah I havent looked at it a ton so I dont spoil myself but im hyped for any elden content
he has some serious range
Oh, cool, a shield
Day9 did a playthrough where he touched every inch of the map and it took him like...literally almost a year
he went so slow, I only watched bits of it
is the parrying in this game as satisfying as the parry in Sekiro is
hahaha yeah its long and there's a lot of cool rando shit to find
this game does a wonderful job rewarding your curiosity in exploration. like a little wall crack can lead into a whole zone
my experience with this game…. how many ways can I go splat from fall damage
I look forward to when you fight Malenia
Good luck Imyt, have fun
Fall damage in this game isn't really a problem though for the most part
I think Imyt will woop Malenia
As long as you aren't jumping from mount everest
I think he will too, but it’ll be fun at first
the only places I got really stuck were the very first boss and the very last boss.
I think imyt will not woop
that boss
LOL Not the tree boss, the first...whats his face
We'll see
I think he’ll get cooked by Malenia til he learns the patterns and when to attack
I ran from the tree boss
yeah I came back
peepoArrive did you already finish stormveil castle?
after
yoooo leo
oh ok
Wait did you kill tree sentinel first imyt? OMEGALOOL
I really wanted a certain shield and spent a fair bit of time going splat to get it. I have always been a gamer that sees a pit and falls in it to see how painful the fall is
he did kill tree sentinel
I was also a lil cheese bitch though, I actually enjoyed the story of this game
I was a caster all day
today I woke up and booted up the game, made a new character and went to try the dagger strat, got this dagger and also started dual wielding
Everyone who hasn't played all the previous fromsoft games kill him first lol
honestly
it sucks ass
OMEGALOOL
@AsheWynLucatiel I killed him first, having played previous from soft games
It doesn't... suck ASS...
just isn't that good lol
this dag is pretty good for pvp I think
because of the blood loss
Oh no it's not OP, but it's not amazing
Most daggers suck. But that dagger is really good
slow two handers are funny
thats me, big BONK weapons
KEKW
Get nuked
dual wielding, it’s cool but if you don’t know what you’re doing (like me) it’ll suck
for a dagger it's pretty good
🍑 🍑 shaking that tho
YEP then find one
ASSA aniv
imytLove imytLove imytLove
the heck
I feel like you're realy low level but I dont know exactly where you are progression wise
Oh right did you kill margit or give up for the time being?
oh this is fucked LOL
Cool cool
Just was curious
Ah yeah
was that the one you get accidently teleported to?
yeah you are NOT meant to kill that fucking boss early
yeah those shrimps are so hard early
I think that teleport is a classic troll
It ain't friendly LUL
I dunno enough about daggers I Just fucking astro-blasted everyone like a wimp
playing the game is not cheese
Hey, Imyt? Can I give a vague 'did you know' or would it be spoilers?
Elden ring, nice. I powerleveled my character and ruined my experience unfortunately. Looking forward to the DLC though.
that sounds like spoilers
Hmm
Hmm
HmmCouncil
you did
up there is where Margit is
and the entrance to the castle
they can message me
Ok, what I was gonna say is fine.
If the replacement headband takes a while, you could reinforce the one you have by gluing (super glue in vertical lines) a stronger elastic to the existing.
Did you know that some bosses only appear at night?
oh, no, I didn't know that part
I thought the elastic was the problem
granny gonna gum those digits
you know George R R Martin wrote the story for this?
Etuca, I have that image, and I can't unsee it.

oh
i was making a map rando joke
there is a pillar icon

Yep, Elden Ring is very good at subtly giving hints, even at the map locations
When's helldiver's bro?

It's fun. I like it
yeah im playing for the first time too.  have fun

just more distance
It's the same, just farther roll
same amount of frames but further distance on roll
HUGE
Easy to dodge though, just pay attention

you can upgrade your weapons on the roundtable too

@leotrinds He survived at 1 hp, huh?

What gargoyles?
Those are BATS
you will get overleveled fast in this game
theres so much shit
and everything gives you shit
76+27
90+19
bit low because of your stats
is it pronounced leever? HUH
KEKW
ive heard both
OK I thought I was being fooled my whole time
First time with Fromsoft Dogs?
this guys can solo tree sentinel
Unironically, dogs are the worst enemies in these types of games
^^
But you're fine fighting these, whereas bladehawks?
He's right. I actually have a doge summon that solos the tree sentinel. Admittedly, it's due to status,, but....
EZ game
you killed that guy on the horse KEKW
what stats you need for that?
it is pretty strong I have used it before
Cheesecake Factory, Eagle crashed it
As in David Bowie Labyrinth?
Boris Johnson?
when they fall on the ground you can also do a critical if you R1 them, just so you know
No katana? Such a disgrace! At least Charles knows what he is doing
These guys kind of remind me of the fire dancers in their movement
Old friend ahead
did you just get attacked by Sasquatch?
I understood the message
OMEGALOOL
its a recurring claymore in dark souls series
everyone loves it
Never sell the gear, unless it's a common enemy drop
gear isnt worth shit, never sell it
^^
yea dont sell gear
you can if its dupe armor or whatever but generally keep everything
unless you have like one bagillion of the same item and you want to get rid of the repeats
probably timing is tight
I usually have a torch for my cave exploring endeavours and no, theres a lot of dungeon left KEKW

hello friend
This guy is used as a boss in a few areas
Really weak tho
the sound design is pretty cool, actually sounde like someone screaming with their head in metal pan
Goes utterly berserk if you bleed him
For good reason if you go by the lore

Nope, it's not useless at all

you can just teleport to the grace you just fell if you want to, thats a good thing about this game

you have to sit
teleporting is cheating angy

you should have to use the sign to return to grace, like a real souls game

they are sleeping
depends on what counts as a combo here
Twinblade Talisman increases the damage of the final hit in an attack chain by 45%
its only the last hit of the combo
press l1 like 3 or 4 times
yes but whats a "combo"
you are missing something
not done here yet
i would think you are never REQUIRED to teleport

you can farm stones somewhere
eh dont worry too much about running out of stuff right now
you can respec and also the smiting stone are ez to get
stones also have a tiering anyway
yo that rat dropped something
and if I remembmer correctly rats loot is DOPE in dark souls

DS1 rats drop humanity
idk about ER tho
probably just bones or something
not ER rat loot though
he dropped down
yeah there was a rat loot back there
not er?

Did I just see imyt use some sort of ranged attack?
oh
KEKW
And to think this is the super easy version at minimum scaling
daggers is hard mode for me
I definitely did not get FG my first time
yo @stimpackdealer do you do PNG-tubers?
enemies do not scale
I got Mr Ears first time
YEP All Dark Souls games have scaling, this one is really blatant about it
Bleed is super strong almost all game
It's by area
thers no scaling, but later areas have higher level enemies with set stats
well bleed is % of enemy hp
so... that makes sense
percentage based damage is always a good thing ngl
excuse me, in this game its not called bleed, its called hemorrhage Nerdge
fucking NERD Nerdge
Nerdge
this battle I won using ashe summons YEP
i dont recall if i ever beat this fight
@leotrinds Hemorrh-AGE? Wow, way to make Imyt self conscious Oldge

Damn so close
Your doing pretty well with really low health
I felt like its much better to double hand the better dagger
Well, you do have a shield, I remember you picked one up
we dont do shields here NoThanks
the problem with any status proc is that it takes more and more hits to proc it
@leotrinds Yeah, fair, we die like men here KEKW
my second playthrough I dual wielded katanas
it is fast, has more range
and also causes bleed
Shields don't work well on this boss anyways tbh
The difference between watching and playing is crazy, watching you I can feel the pattern a lot better, but when I play I'm just going "Ahhh please leave me alone!"
You always need to balance your health though
@daersora watching is so much easier
Damage will come with weapon upgrades mainly
I feel like your hp is lacking
I feel like its the same in sports when people on their couches can be all annoyed by players that didnt do the obvious best play they could, but if you go and try the sport yourself you will see that you WONT SEE things that easily
mana flask maybe?
fair
Just equip the Sniper dood
I'm on NG+2 on ER, gotta say knives are still shit leotrinds lol
Exactly leo, it's why I try to be supportive, because I know I failed much harder than imyt on most of these bosses
daggers are shit

equip that sword

Give it a swing swang
so you see how cool it is
MB attacks him three times
You can always respec later if you feel like trying a different route
That sword's ability gives you a temporary +40 levels
Lol
KEKW
THIS IS MUCH BETTER THAN DAGGERS
Just from sheer awesome
KEKW
this is not easy but def better than daggers
you can respec many times
easy mode is magic, obviously
Need 40 Str though
You can respec later

Yo, that's was lifted straight from a historical Japanese Battle
it was a whole bridge area beside the second bonfire
that you cant get back to it after you fell the second bonfire
by bonfire I mean grace
my brain is hardwired to dark souls
Area prior to the 2nd grace drop down, yeh
@stimpackdealer Currently I'm thinking like just a couple still frames kinda thing. like a base frame and one that's like an open mouth
or you could do like distortion2 and just not be on camera KEKW
@ShiroiTenshii Oh are you looking to make one? feel free to DM me if you've got some more questions/info
DEJJ
I would like a something for streaming, yea
dejj
Deadge
@ShiroiTenshii Yeah hit me up if you're interested - I do all kinds of art
Misbegotten suck
the game implies that you have sick ashes of war so its fine to use them
it was there
it is here
yes
am baack
fighting the urge 😴
prolly done
there is a sidequest with this dood if you speak to another npc first
but pretty minor
whens 99 str? pepeW
who's an expert of this game?
you have a Claymore now, which is a pretty decent 2 hand sword
if you want to try that
@ShiroiTenshii I have 2 phds in this game
which weapon is better: "scythe" or "grave scythe" or "winged scythe"
leo gigl
Eh I appreciate the rep lol
I like winged scythe the most for the ash on it
grave is higher base stats, but it looks like scythe get better scaling
easly grave
@daersora winged scythe is fun, running that now in my game
My first playthrough I got winged scythe and it was all I used
grave also looks cooler NODDERS
@ShiroiTenshii EXACTLY
fashion souls
we dont use better equipment here NoThanks
k if i remember that next time i install the game
KEKW
shouOkay
Winged scythe is also split across physical and holy damage, which can be bad
its great for undeads...
but kinda mid for everything else
undeads are trash
you can literally uninstall the game if you die to undeads
If you follow Varre's quest line, bleed builds get a whole lot better
LOL
jk you can die to anything
you had to run
but this works
KEKW
monkaW what are these bloodstains
I use winged scythe.........
Varre is the first guy you find
White masked Man from the first grace
the white mask guy you met first
why is there so many deaths here wtf
outside of the heros grave you spawn that there is the tutorial
the one that called you MAIDENLESS
its far off
No maidens? PepeLaugh
he will appear multiple times in the game, you cant do anything for now
Yeah exhaust his dialogue and you'll find him later
he is bad
Usually always top option yes
so probably dont need a seat
I mean he is a baddie
not bad quest
he is evil hehe
he wants you to go to stormveil
and kill the boss there
you dont need to do this now
You have to go through Stormveil Castle
you can keep exploring the island south
theres a lot of things there
Zoom out real fast
I want you to loot and you said you want loot backseat KEKW
Ok nice
imytWhine
zoom in...real slow like
there is a few caves in this islsand too
Have you ever seen the full map or is it all blind for you
I think he knows nothing
there are caves and things to loot everywhere, the game rewards exploration...but not always for your build or preferences
he has no idea this game is the size of Brazil
I gotta play this again soon
Ya I think so
that's why I started playing again
there is three spirit turtles
you kill them and it unlocks
2 more
🐢
doog was just chillin
and you killed him
peepoLeaveFinger
That's kgg number 292
yeah they are all close to the tower
like few meters
bro you didn't beat this game yet

KEKW
my cousin beat this game in 2 hours
Yeah
in this game is kinda useless because you can just teleport
34 hours
it is one time use
thats how long it took aniv to beat ER
one of the is invisible in the water KEKW
so im at my parents and suffering on this tiny laptop screen
just gonna say it outright
i miss my dual monitor setup Sadge
Hmmm so .. they can be pretty well hidden
KEKW
wow IB bragging about his dual monitor setup
Dog ahead
im on mobile squinting real hard

I forgot where the third one is
they are not talking about these dogs
there is meme in ER that people leave messages on turtles with the word "dog"

You won't have the special dagger moveset
you need to equip just that
it MIGHT be better tho KEKW
you can dual wield two of these for sure
just have to farm it

probably cooler than dagger
you might want to always farm those white flowers on catacombs
They are okay moveset is slower to bleed though

you can fire grease the whip too

I think it's 5% bonus damage for any weapon 2 handed
SCAMMED
@ANDRU_OMEDA no
1.5x
anything two handed is 1.5x base damage
use one of those with reduvia!
if you can
i thought it was +50% strength
@ShiroiTenshii yep, 1.5x KEKW
ohhh my bad yeah
but only str tho, not damage
OH YOU ARE RIGHT
I only use str
OMEGALOOL
then that damage applies to weapon scaling
i mean strength
it'll have a good night!
maaaaan
whips is ass
imyt can you test the 1h vs 2h damage of the whip?
There is a bleed whip out there
It's clobbering time
big stick goes bonk
only way to play
We need an Imyt to clobber that there monsta!
the sowrds are better
much
Blunt is better for them yeah
two hand it too YEP
hmm
flail is too
it says strike, under the name
I guess it's called Strike
they are both strike
its a buff
OMEGALOOL
it's just an art of war tho
you can get those art of wars for any weapon
you can intheory put it on any weapon type
two hand it pepeW

You know, this and another boss are my favorite boss in the game.
Mostly for a cheesy strategy that makes them hilarious
This boss usually doesn't have adds
I agree on add bosses lol. Hate em
boss that has ads peepoAds
Adge
Yep, normally I hate bosses with adds. But this one is hilarious if you do a certain thing, which DOES activate the friendly fire... Not telling you what of course.
thats cuz run is shit
for combat
fire already gone? HUH
I can tell you, you are not going to use the loot from this boss
kinda looks like boss adds have more hp?
bosses with adds like these in the catacombs are designed for you to use ashe summons btw
they probably will drop an ash summon
there are not summons that are strong enough to fight for you, just to take the aggro off of you
there is actualy
but idk if it was nerfed
DonkBonks DonkBonkL
With all these misses, are we playing Elden Ring or XCOM? KEKW

the club is cursed
it did hit
need a bigger club
im assuming this is a no backseating situation
Got hit by the tipper
correct
I much rather the big swords
getting tippered like fighting marth
Sweet spot, Marth cat killed at 30 percent
you can DUAL WIELD BIG SWORDS BTW
you have 2
omg leo KEKW
shiroi thats literally how I play
no I meant
nono DUAL WIELD greatswords
dual wield big SWORDS
like two at once
seriously, try it
Dual wield ultra greatswords like BONKules
just jump L1
enourmous damage
with dual wield
there is potentially a reason why your club r2 seems different depending on what you were doing before
no L1 for the dual attack
with dual wield its L1

Hey @etuca sorry, I'm kinda half paying attention :P got the stream up on the tv in the shop, but im outside having a bonfire haha!
no worries, hope you're having a good night :)
Yay!
@etuca yea, ive actually had a very good past couple of days :) was struggling with anxiety for the past 2 weeks, made a simple change to my diet, noticed instant results, feeling great now! Getting tons done!
awesome, glad to hear that

Could you imagine if people actually slid around like that to get around hahaha!!!!
@analog56x I've had dreams where that's how I would. It was a lot of fun
@obedmaziah haha i haven't dreamt in a long time... i imagine it would be pretty fun though :P
I mean, I was a kid. I haven't had dreams in a long while too
is not dreaming the secret to a good sleep? Sadge
Last dreams i had were actually nightmares haha, so i prefer not to :P but im also wondering if that's what's an issue with a lot of people... deep sleep where you dream is REM sleep, and if we never enter it, then we aren't getting the best sleep, and will eventually run a deficit :(
i probably average 2-3 vivid dreams a night and i probably average 1/2 good sleeps a year lol
Oh wow, etuca, what's your secret? Haha :P
idk... probably just being a huge degen
I used to vivid dream when i was a lot younger haha
when the train charges, you get off the tracks
I tend to avoid trains KEKL i went for a walk and got ambushed by s train about a week ago hahaha
LUL
i need to go do dishes and cook dinner but ive been too enthralled with this race
I would have assumed dreaming is usually the sign of good sleep. You usually don't remember dreams if you don't wake up in the middle of it, and the more you sleep, the longer the dream vs deep sleep cycles. So I usually remember dreams only when I've had a good, long sleep.
Although if it's dreams that wake you up, then I guess that doesn't apply.
LETSGO I CAN CATCH THE RIGB
Yea, the only dreams i remember are the nightmares because they wake me up hahaha :P

two-handing weapons effectively increases the strength you have which translates into more damage
you made him angy
ok but what if you dual wield those PauseChamp
stubbornness is definitely the hardest enemy in the game LUL
it depends on the enemies and your build
I knew it was free KEKL
FWIW that's not a boss or anything
lol
likely not very useful on bosses
bigger weapons do more stagger
yeah
and the southern area you for the most part done
sup imyt
feels like you should have jumped in the hole or something
you still can Shruge
you can upgrade at hte blacksmith in the roundtable
It's either gonna be really good, or really bad
that anvil is limited to lvl 2 upgrades
probably, idk. Never played the game.
ed i think its a crossbow and prayerbook
not good stuff in there
a ranged weapona nd some spells
this place is just the HUB
jump off the balcony

yeah a Seal
you need the weapon yea
you can find someone if you jumpk off the balcony

I fucking hated this place on my first playthrough.
Good luck
daggers shred on humaniods
LUL
if you have one fist weapon and two hand it, it goes on both hands
you can try
Imyt is wolverine?!
yes
Id do claws, seems badass
havent heard that theyre good at all
I did fist weapons on my first playthrough. Mega fun
i imagine they are similar to daggers Shruge
Though claws aren't the best fist weapon if that's your question
weapons in this game have pretty real-world limitations, and it reflects on their popularity
fist weapons dual wield 2H
no you can two hand with one fist weapon, dont need a second
you got that weapon as a placed loot tho, not a drop
try it
do it
Fuck yeah! We're wolverine!!!!
LETSGO
oh cool

@tecolote1280 nalvExcited
yeah
bleed and ex, yep
idc lol
dex
he will understand, fist is badass
This is badass
guraWave bye bye ranged attack
the reason daggers and claws aren't popular is because they're short
With those claws you have 3 daggers on each hand
arcane no longer scales, that was reduvia specific
for sure
this guy became warwick
yes
yes you can
you could go upgrade those real quick
there are more
theres are 4
there are better claws
but you can also spec them into certain elements
not the reduvia

you retain the bleed i think
you can imbue elements to any Non-unique weapon
special weapons, the ones that upgrade using somber stones, and a couple exceptions, can't have their ability changed
looks fun, go for it!
bleed is like you're cutting them open and causing bleeding wounds basically
so its like innate to the weapon
Those claws are WAY better than the daggers. Easy to Lv up too
KEKW
LUL
be careful near those TNT barrels
red barrels LUL
you will be swimming in them
there will be more stones
yeah check the ashes
yes you can set an ash of war
ashes are a 1time use iirc
one-place use, but reusable
its on your dagger right now, youll lose your quickstep tho
imytBoyardee
illegal bennyk5Arrive bennyk5Shred bennyk5Shred
ashes of war is the L2 ability
Also, you can imbue the claws too. You can easily not use any other weapon but these claws (wolverine build)
you have to move them around unless you duplicate them
yeah you gotta find the,
go to bernhal he sells the moves
gigl
I need to get to bed, have a good time with claws imytGarGrab
Well, im done for the night imyt, nighty night. Have a good rest of your stream! Kick some ass with those claws hahaha

@ShiroiTenshii Idont think so, the old R1 Kick is gone
the closer you are, the less you have to move to strafe around them
oh Sadge
next upgrade you might be able to 1hit those guys
nice
nice
useless lol
need a shield
if you attack after blocking, that's a guard counter
it'll make a "SCHWIIIING" sound
guard counters have additional stagger, iirc
sadiaDespair

BirdgeArriveLeave

your weapon of choice makes a huge impact imo
claws look really fun
and everyone seems to have different opinions
i wanna try a scythe
PausersHype
my playthrough was a scythe
where abouts is this on the map?
we in the castle
theres a ton of roof secrets in this place
yep that item is worth it
which castle?
but you can teleport out
you can always telelport if you get stuck
uhh stormveil or w.e it is
You are slaying with the claws tho
ah! thank you @ShiroiTenshii blushcat
Go the other way around that lol

Rip

Jump up the broken column

Just past it

No you're good
i don't think that this castle has that many secrets compare to other one with Renala which has a bunch
Yeah this is your standard architectural Castle
Oh boy

That's Lost Count number 11
Rip there goes the beetle
some are ashes
You'd have to attack with the shield
Ohno
omg
Yepge
dang died to that guy? washed...
Well you can get that ash beetle now
That enemy is the trade-off for getting the shield LUL
You're going to get real used to that walk. SMILERS
you can go down by using the elevator behind you
yeah im shit posting, that guys an asshole, i made him kill himself
idt that shield does anything unless you bash someone with it
Shield isn't worth it, youd have to attack with it
Correct
Crucible knights are no joke
Yeah, the crucible knight can be a pain in the ass
Could run by eventually
pretty sure bushes dont do much
Sneaking in full white robes KEKW
backstab with L1 maaaaan
bro that guy's armor is sick
you can go down by using the elevator behind you
he's got varia
@ShiroiTenshii tbf you can't backstab them I think
oh weird
You can backstab, his elevation was a bit high it seemed
You've picked up a few stones. Don't know if you have enough to upgrade the claws yet
Wait you can? I fought that guy like 500 times.
Pretty sure
there is a sorta weird elevation you have to match for backstabs
Ohno its 4am
Good morning
why am i awake
so does that rocky ledge just like...grow back?
from behind your character looks like Wolverine Jesus
what is this strat, ive beaten the game a few times and i havent seen this run
This was my first souls game, definitely in my top 10
Uh oh
NotLikeThis
He's just got a quick heavy moveset
Bro I remember this part and I hated those guys
If you skip him you can get to him easier
you taking a different route
You can parry them, but those knights have the highest poise in the game. AKA, you ain't stunning them LUL
wait
how tf people put messages on that rock HUH
Oh snap.. I don't think I ever went this way ..
Leaving him for later is fine. You can always revisit
sadiaDespair
last boss gigl
And this seems to be a good time to tell you... there was a grace nearby the whole time LUL
you have to ride the elevator up once first
Yup shortcut
if you're gonna fight the knight
step on the elevator to send it back up and run off it
otherwise you have to pull the lever and wait for it every time
KEKW
Had some good dodges
What lv are you?
Oh you just started SeemsGood
Go back to the daggers for the shits and giggles??
try parry
it might not be a summon area
Yup
Just do it™
he doesnt have a parry think
Can't summon in that area
you'll need a shield to do parry
Daggers should have faster bleed
sure he can
but its a build up bar that slowly decays
so while ur disengaged, the buildup is falling off
Looked like he almost fell after you
KEKW
Two weapons of bleed yes
I don't think they suffer from anything. Poison, bleed etc.
No just better damage
oh... yea he's immune to bleed
And if they do, they have an incredibly low proc rate
I may not be right, but you may want to increase your dex for the type of gameplay you're going with..I went glass mage and it was a lot of fun.. and I guess easier because of range capabilities too LUL
Rip yeah he's immune to bleed, didn't know that
@ANDRU_OMEDA I don't know what I'd like to be Madge
with what runes neff gigl
@shiroitenshii NotLikeThis
Just do a level 1 gameplay SMILERS
they just went everywhere that ISNT margit KEKW
OR farming runes for hours
Yeah that's the thing about open-world, you can go where-ever you want basically.
Weak to fire and lightning
So chances are, you can go into harder places without knowing.
like the lake of rot gigl
Your vigor is stressing me out
I went south.. it's hard no latter what when you're low level I feel.. once you hit 100+ you do more damage but 200+ is when you're a beast
they arent that limited gKEKW
Veigar?
@smellypolar LUL
Pretty much didn't want to be over healing with your flasks for Vigor

@ShiroiTenshii I think I still would have been wrong LIL
I was
it says B
it seems to good to be true but getting more health by leveling vigor makes melee alot easier
fml and a grilled cheese sammiich
When you have low vigor, you can't make any mistakes. Particularly tough if you're melee.
THE CHEESE
Nope he's gone
No, he doesn't
Left side of dining room
Nah, playing ranged isn't cheesing. Pulling him back toward the lift so you can hit him through the doorway he can't fit through is cheese.

ive never played this game but they look like wolverine claws
Yup
are there classes or just stats?
just stats
so imyt is maxing in sneaky?
sneak is not a stat

It's a bit better
You want more physical defense
Usually
is dex his attack speed?
the vitality and robustness are more for poison/bleed resist etc

He has to power hit the statue

If you were to try that
You can put parry on fist weapons js
so you know how you noticed when you picked up your runed earlier that you didn't get 100% back that you dropped?
thats cos this guy was robbing you every time you died
Yeah fists are pretty bad
thats a stagger resist
You can put that on your claws

Something to be vaguely awarre of.  Smithing Stones are NOT unlimited in the world, if you upgrade too many weapons you may struggle to find stones
correct
Eh was that too tip-like?
wat up, first Elden ring stream I've caught, how many bosses have you fought?
small tip gaySizeUp
eh he ignored it anyways
ok, we out of the oversized insect zone?
BUT you can buy them later
I don’t know how I’m gonna handle that when I get to that part
so they are kind of unlimited
You can buy SOME, you cant buy all
Eh maybe im wrong, I remember after I beat the game and I wanted to try to play a different spec and I had to be looking up guides
beast boss beast boss
yeah I dunno what else to call him
you can buy 99% of them, its really not something to worry about
stop, hammer time
sorry for noping out so quick….them hornets scared me
yo did imyt get mjolnir?
You should go jump down where all the enemies are :)
ok brb gonna start a hammer playthrough
I don't get these results with the hammer in Bloodbourne KEKW
hammer is satisfying
I understand spells are cheesy.  But shields being cheesy? People gotta block man
lol imagine hiding behind wood and metal
fucking loser
the clapback is kinda cheese
ahahah yeah makes sense
but I think bosses still own you most of the time
he has crazy in the name for a reason
My experience with shields in FromSoft games is that its a pretty easy way to start out, but later areas will destroy you if you rely to much on it
@imyt just so you're aware, there is a shield that up stam recovery even if you just wear on your back
its called Great Turtle Shell
clap this mans and get out
charged heavy woulda one shot
that does look cool AF
they call him IRon Burgundy

you have to go up an elevator here, then drop down another elevator from above
Oh daily death counter is new
Yeah down
cool
oh wow that's teeeeny
You have to go through the buildings
no no
the grind size
yeah
Yup there
No back most one
did you check to see if you have the turtle shieldy?
grind size is inverse to steep time. consistent grind size is the most important part of repro
when we would use our burr grinder for our old machine we would grind on the smallest setting. but since we don't see it actually grind now and it's just a number, we're just going by what the machine is telling us if it's too big or what
sheeeit
yeah same happened to us
i bought local though (feel good dopamine) and it was really fresh beans, like roasted not even two weeks ago
it's been tastyyyy
honestly the quality is just so much nicer now
Only 3 good beans there? That's not even enough for a shot...
the first cup was like oh shiiiit
yeah
it's way too sweet
Keep going
i was reading something about having to be careful with the flavored beans in the espresso makers though, since those beans tend to be more oily
and the oiliness isn't good for the machine
try jumping, there's bound to be a stake of marika Kappa

there's a big hammer later on that has bleed and lifesteal. you can also dual wield it if you have the equip load

probably only end game zebugman
if the dark souls dlc are anything to go by
they just expand
darth maul build POG
you can L2 and do a follow up R1 or R2 with that double sword

no, there is ground where the boss is
you dont have to worry
you can L1 to hit left
KEKW
He's a commander tho
That weapon has a really good buff
this boss took me like 20 tries
was like lvl 50 or something tho
this was a first try for me
WICKED
that needle goes to Gowry, in a shack to the East
BAKI
yo Imyt! you made it so far past the tree sentinel now
imyt would probably first try tree sentinel now
commanders standard
its a halberd probably
you can store weapons you arent using at grace, btw
KEKW
"FOLLOW ME!" - hides behind turtle shield
you can store itens if you want to on the grace
not necessary tho
you have a storage box at graces
"sort chest"
I never really understood the point of the storage box
nop
no
it is just for organizing
I dont ever organize shit
yeah it's great thanks
imytLove imytLove imytLove
Shruge
its just a flasks one
but big
perfumes can be good
nice buffs and stuff
isnt that staff busted early game
yeah

it's still useful even late game on the offhand
imyt let me show where there is a night boss only with a busted magic weapon
and there's my favorite spell

Yeah tower
That'll be fun

yeah
KEKW
game is like Skateparkge
PTSD
theres a grace nearby
Hmm

How much I sucked to death
close to the road
dont need grace WICKED
deaths poker is a greatsword
KEKW
its a strenght weapon
a huge rod
it is pretty fucking good
because of the ash
this is where your sorting box comes in handy haha
and its frost
halflife 2 crowbar POG
I guess it's just to get rid of the items you will never use so it's easier to find things you might use
yeah
the needle
no you have to do a puzzle on the town
and climb up
you havent
you didnt do the town puzzle, I can see from the map
you have to light three flames there
Is Sellia the ancestor of Victoria?
there is three flames on the rooftops of the houses on the town down there
you just light them and it opens a path further
invisible Burger Kings monkaS
That ghost must've been a noob
There are towers on the roofs you need to light
imyt sup imytLove
"Oh, this place" neenalSip

but they give you double jump for a reason
Miyazaki will find out and patch it
you said it again tomorrow
how do you keep pressing the dpad KEKW
catPunchU
that one scarab you need ranged weapons
it teleports
you cant use great arrows on things that arent great bows
double slash is good
you would love that ash of war
thats the third flame, did you flame three?
now all the seals are broken if you did three flames
the seals on the ground are loot
the seal to the left of town is a boss
the seal up, close to the gold seed tree is progress
no
yeah, north and left of town
not down
finish the game with 40vig you won't
I stopped at 50
oh hey it's my weapon
the lusat glintstone staff that is
yeah
cheese staff StinkyCheese
HEY
dont put the claymore in the box
the claymore is cool
try it
kamikaze
sorry when I said try it I meant the explosive physick tear
stance damage +30%
but the claymore is MA HERITAGE
the cracked tear
you have to go to progress
up the hill
yes
Shruge
there are painting around that, if you find exactly the location of the paiting
they have items
more stance damage means you'll stagger enemies quicker
That scream
doesnt just make you do more damage
peepoClap peepoClap peepoClap
I was about to type in portuguese for some reason, I was typing that there is nothing where you were jumping KEKW
First death today?

@crazyal_ D:
Imyt does not approve of unionized miners or labor laws. Imyt will teach those miners a lesson.
no but right would lead to here
down first, down is not the path
you are going towards the path
go down the crystal here
toadArrive
This place looks like the run up to Seath in DS
this area is where right path would lead, I dont think there is anything
yeah
there's a lot of paths
catArrive Hello imyt and friends
this gets you out
this is a maze and a half
monkaHmm where did I get this hype conductor badge
you didnt miss anything so far
this seal can only be broken if you follow the witch questline
this door is a part of a quest
the one that you beat when she was chained
no
her questline is huge
yeah her questline will take quite a while
you are going to where you fought that horrible monster
O you don't have the right
by the way O you don't have the right
finger, but hole
keep exploring
... !lost?
I want to go home...
there is a path up there to the right
yeah
hug right wall
It's up on a crystal
you cam from here
VICTORY!
up on a crystal
not yet aniv letcook
V I C T OMEGALUL R Y !
praise the sun!
this is not what
oh you got the turtle regen shield nice dude
I was trying to lead
but its fine
the crystal is up
not this one
its more up
these ones
yeah
that is the path
Falls are so scary in this game
burger kings KEKW
that some damage
yes
Hammer is good against almost every mob
they are weakest to strike damage
blunt damage is op
no more loot here
you fully explored it
we made it efficient
KEKW
ROT TRIO ROT TRIO
good thing you have the right weapon for this boss
oh yeah, these things...
I think I was lower level when I fought them
Imyt worrying about enemies when he kills all of them in 3 hits KEKL
you would be SCREAMING with your claws here, they dont take any damage by anything that isnt a big strike weapon
lol gg
stagger is big win
theres not much a big bonk can't deal with
all good with this cave you can move on pepeOk
DADDY
aniv HUH
https://clips.twitch.tv/NimbleBoringSquirrelKeepo-XYtUP5a53Nsm2_80
thats it
good loot
great loot even
I would say probably one of the best loots sofar
you can kill that big dragon for free btw
and get PAID to do it
this one is
the BIG one
imyt look to your right
THE BIIIIIIIG ONE
this is one colossal dragon
That boi
you were not even realizing it KEKW
barely
:( sad
OMEGALOOL
use your claws tho
Just go to the messages at his tail and fuck em up
yeah time to go for bleed
killing the innocent dragon mother :(
He was sleeping chiggenCri
Yeah just keep swinging
this will take a while
I thought it was a she
she is sick and cannot fight back
mother of dragons
only way to speed up is bleed
if you have bleed grease
you can apply that
How long is this gonna take? :o
it takes a while
if you have a gold pickled fowl foot you should eat it before it dies
idk, this is probably quicker
destroy all their pets at once now, so summon items so often is what the mead can do
attacks quick
no she is sick
Nah he out could
no this thing is dying and you are putting it out of its misery
Cold
no, you're just murdering an harmless dragon
:(
claws attack faster
go it its eyes and stab the hole
straight to the brain gotta be faster
she's calling out for help from her children
but you might have killed them all already
It's about to be jackpot time
:(
MONEYYY
is that your first dragon heart?
no
You should eat its heart now
figured not
you did her a favour
she was dying big time rotting alive
technically in the lore killing dragons and using their hearts is blasphemy haha
People do a glitch with that dragon where if you kill it and immediately grace as theyre dying, they remain alive but give souls
you can exchange dragon herats to dragon magic
Clear that castle there
its blasphemous but theres no downsides right?
65 strength holy moly 😂
It's too bad you don't turn into a dragon from eating all the hearts like in the lore
nah
@crazyal_ nah not that I know of
dragon communion yep, dragon magic
No can't cannibalize the hearts
you eat them when you gain spells
you can learn dragon spells by eating the dragon hearts at the church of dragon comunion
and your eyes become dragon eyes
Dragon Haggis
Oh really? Didn't know you eat them, thought you toss it into the ritual altar
they call it Fort Faroth because its so far away from where you start the game
Sounds like it might be the port of the controller
hahaha
this area is batty
We can't stop here, this is bat country!
You can now use the grand lift!!

waste your souls first, this place you will die alot
When's the last time you leveled your weapon?
Ah alright
yea man lots of deadly jumping to get below
I am talking from experience i spent so much time in this tower trying to make the jumps down
LETSGO
go right first
yes it is indded hard and those tough enemies are back
back the other way
if you get all the bell bearings you can buy those stones for crafting at that castle
just need to get them from the shacks, the boss guy with the floating sword on full moons has them
I can explain if you want me to
I was
Ta daaaaaa
you beat the boss at the shacks to get them
at grace
arguably best late game rune
the other stat increases get smaller as you level, whereas Radahn's rune is a percentage
there is a shack right near the tower there
@AngryHelder Are you talking about the night-time bosses?
Go to the merchant shack nearby to the left
Yeah go for that
the fuck I've never done this area
Saved
Lucked out lol

Yeah his set is dope

You'll be good I think
Ez mode
switch to sword for challenge
I remember when imyt was melee only..........
KEKW
You need to go back to the tower
Weak
You're running back to the elevator
They wanted to make sure you got to see you scratch your butt a bunch
yeah you could
i could give you another giant crusher xD
yeah fair
Giant Crusher + Royal Knight's Resolve is some nice damage
People jumpin off the cliff
You have both
have you got royal knights resolve in volcano manor?
you get two
Mohg's is here too
I think
check them on grace
Yep
mounatian tops
Catacombs... Get the 2nd half of the Haligtree Medallion
Kill the boss of the Mountains area.  Many things to do
you might have the aracne one
nope nvm
Stonebarb ?
the fire talisiman does +12% more damage but increases your damage taken by 10%
have you done these catacombs? ?
No.  It's an optional area
Like Volcano Manor
You're to style on them while they just throw shit at you
The summons?  Or the ashes of war?
these catacombs are something else
i regret not getting it....with his family
sadiaDespair sadiaDespair sadiaDespair sadiaDespair sadiaDespair sadiaDespair
Understandable.  It's easier to learn how to fight without the summons

Got cornered
Lol
3 headed cat
frostbite is my least favourite status effect to deal with
Try the Pillar tactic again imytCursed
Try the sword ahhhhh
Sword is big poise damage
All of these enemies are stone types so spears don't work well
If you got spare sombers you should
Maybe you can stand on the pedestal.  Or maybe it'll squish you
Ah.  Repec incoming
You got more stones than tears I think
Have you ever turned your deathroots in?
The North most place in calied
The castle area there has some stuff.  There's the boss of the snow area.  There's a dragon
He gives you incantations and a weapon I think
Doing the castle area in the north part of the snow place will get you to a place you can get more ancient somber stones
imytJam imytJam imytJam imytJam
docking your pay by a dollar a frame
Rest now
hf hf
Teach him a lesson but don't kill him
He wants more death root
The death root makes him lose his mind
Gone berserk basically
He friendly now
You can fight him in the area in front of the stairs
Damn he his hard
You're not going to make me sad lol
He kills himself cause ranni is not around anymore
How upgrade at the roundtable now
No.  Assassins
omg tecito con flash
There's a blackflame assassin by his body
Sword?
Alrighty
How much can you upgrade the giant crusher?
You can only upgrade here now
Ijji's bell just let's you by 1s and 2s and then 3 of 3s and 4s each and that's about it
You doing giant crusher or brick hammer?
Ah alright
Nah giant crusher ftw
There's is a talisman to gain more runes
In calied
It's kinda a hidden area
Golden Scarab
Want to grab that M
?
The foot thing yeah
Gold Pickled Fowl Feet
That lasts until you rest or die pretty much
That too
It lasts for 3 minutes, you die, or you teleport
You have to wear the frog mask to hit them consistently. *wink**wink*
I'm just joking
Your close to getting the last stone bell bearing
I think it takes 12 total of each.  2 then 4 then 6
Only stones you can't buy are the ancients
Wrong one!!
you nut
Did you just altf4
KEKW
I think it saves on upgrade lol
Maybe if you were offline but oh well
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do to try to save
Ooooo
YOu're in good shape
SAVED!!!!
You had 16 6s last time
i have no active duels to accept rejection
Nice
Now check for Royal knights resolve ash
That's better than determination
Jump attack more fun lol
He doesn't have RKR.  Didn't go through the door to get it
Ah alright
Crank strength to 75

Endurance should be up there
I would do 15 mind
Yeah true
That looks good
Now you should try to get Royal knights resolve
sick build. are you gonnna use turt shield for stam too?
That's in volcano Manor right before the boss teleporter
Increase poise break physick
Alrighty yeah
might gotta use the equip talisman
Maybe jar talisman
Probably not
Jar talisman is slept on for strength
its probly the same. they stack though
and what's wrong with that? Are you fat shaming, imyt? StareSus
good, then turn into an onion
The godskin boss grace
You'll want the Temple of Eiglay grace
^
Then go all the way to the end with all the snakes
Take the long elevator up
Other way
There's one outside to the left
the wiki is a godsend
Other way
It like inside but left side of the room
From the grace, facing the statues, go to the left
face the alter and to the left
Yes
Yeah that tower out there
Yeah you can keep going then a ladder around the left side
Oh nvm keep going
ninja turt hitting for 3k damage is pog
Straight
Yeah that was
Way
All the way to the end, then into the room.  Up the first stairs but then turn right and go up the stairs behind you
You can get that just a long farm
In this room it's up to your left
Yup
Yep
allans6DogNice

Rip
I think you can just drop off the first left
ahardgameaboutclimbing flashbacks
Ledge
When you get in that room you can drop to the right
Big stone helm got in the way
You don't have to jump to the cage
I'm not sure if you can make it from the cage, but I've never tried.
Worth trying
Yeah just drop down
Called his friends
Bed Head Curse
Yeah it's not bad
you just picked up someones cursed prostate
Yup
Yup he's in every from soft game

Patches can push you down into a ravine if you were to follow those rainbow stones in the mountain
Catacomb time

Kreygasm
imyts just goated at hard af games
But have you heard of Malenia yet?
💁🏻‍♂️
Ooo boi
real chad unlike me, im the first to spam the summons. LUL
it'll be tough, but he also first tried radahn
Yeah from plus 60% to plus 80%
Did you put it on heavy
Alright
It allows you to stagger more but less damage
That thing be staggering a lot anyway
You could allocate a flask back to health
You could
"this catacomb is something else"
2 hit nice
Rump booty
I think you're done down this way
PotFriend
True
imytPoggies massacre
No platforms for the blades
they did it :(
Those exploding ones can be rough
Hmmm
It's been a while since you've had long walks
More vigor?
Yeah it's odd
Land squirts
Just roll around em
Probably get those guys without the buff
NVM lol
I think that's the one you dropped down before
Now go to the elevator
I think that's different
Yeah might have the lever somewhere through that jar area
whatever way works.
This place is confusing asf
I don't think so that's the first drop
That's the first drop
Ooooo yeah
look under elevator
ah, you got the big bonk now
Take that fall after loot
Yeah idk how to get back lol
Nah 1 hit
Uh oh
Nice!!
EZ
He only goes crazy once
Yeah that was convoluted
Spell
Another spell
You can use it tho I think
Nope he still there lol
Could use a boss runes
Vigor?
Yeah for this play style stamina Regen isn't too important
Bonk and done
ooh yeah, now you really bonking
respec
That haliberd is good
that's what I did my first playthrough
Just need more Dex
its better late game, when you have more trinkets
for the twin blades
No he chill
there is one that increases dmg when you proc bleed
and one that increases dmg each time you hit
kgg
and twin blade hits a lot when in the air
imytJam imytJam imytJam
Nice shirt btw

this is multiworld, wdym?
@Yndril I'm just being a shitter amsbtLUL
unlocked the shop?
Imyt... why are you not buying geos for andy?
the shop has requirements? sheesh, that's not savvy business
That wouldn't happen if I was the shopkeeper, let me tell ya
@Namjies Bapa nada imytNodders
do you have a simple key?
no, you can just hit up to ascend
Lurien
The next silver guy is only steel soul
cause there's no shade if you can't die
so he's there instead and just gives you money for eggs
no enemies here give geo
i would probably use it over sprintmaster, at least if i have dash
Good luck Imyt, have fun
no, but longer range
then again, if you are used to the standard range it might throw you off instead
Wow rikkuWowie
🐦
shadow dash deals damage, not sure if it works on normal dash
there was a bench up there though
with a shop
yeah
you both warped back to queens station? XD
Reset oatsMad
up right right up
acid
yeah
you can add grubs to the map tracker
uh, give me a minute
start bottom left side of the screen is the map tracker settings, customize pins and click on grubs
oh, different options in multiworld/rando, my bad, got you in the right direction though
yo! how are you liking this randomizer?
can you show me the full map a sec and hover over a bench?
is this current patch or 1.11?
gonna be terrified when I go to SF LUL
aniv???
is that a threat?
benchwarp
love the rando menu
best addition
can you check a benchpin?
hold over a bench
yeah, been branching into OOT and Stardew recently for Archi randos
yeah that's what i thought
essence checks
i don't think the benchwarp from map works in vanilla, so wasn't sure if it works in multiworld
you have abysal shriek though
charm
you can go to the customize poool and add dream bosses now too
left on xbox
you can add them to the pool too
boss essence
whispering roots is the trees
you can go through king's station
imytJam
yeah
sounds like a good plan
you can do like 20 person randos
even more if you play through AP, but that's a curse word to Andy
Andy doesn't like Archi?
not sure if he changed his mind on it, but there was some bad blood between the head of archi and the alttp community
alttpr*
haven't heard of any suing, only the guy reporting alttpr website to GDPR
LUL he'd be crazy to sue
yeah, but think you need wall jump to reach him
you'd have to open it through sanctum
yello mr imyt hope you are doin alright
he did it
neat!
that was pretty good
clutch
first upgrade only cost geo
yeah, if you get another 300 geo you probaly want to upgrade again
i'm not sure actually
you cant get the bench
you need claw
you can reach sanctum tho
you should be able to get the bench in the waterways though
yeah, waterways bench
but isn't that a one way rn?
it mmight be, but at least it's a shortcut for later
whats up?
that was pretty nice XD
was nice
not from this side
you have to go from kings station
actually
you can
pretty smart
forgot you have crystal heart
you already went there
yeah, logically you need to ahve all simple keys
800
nah, the bug drowned
and save the flying bugs for pogo
it's free once you know about it, but you didn't so that's pretty neat :D
if you hold over the grubs, it'll say unreachable if you can't reach them, they're hard to see if they're in logic or not
down here
you're in the far upper right
no this is the right one
tigeltSpin imytJam tigeltSpin imytJam tigeltSpin imytJam tigeltSpin imytJam tigeltSpin imytJam tigeltSpin imytJam
right
Imyt's brain is imytSleeper
you're in the far bottom left side
the rest require wall jump in here
or, you might be able to get one grub
you're here early as balls
you can check if they are reachable by hovering over them
you do, you just can't reach them
can you reach him without mantis claw or infected crossroads?

Andy is so supportive Gladge
this guy is one of easier essence bosses
100
from this one
false knight gives 300 i think
i think you got distant village stag
you have to add that vanilla pin
to see the stag stations
through the shaft
not much left you can do
have you checked the left shop in town?
oh yeah, hjust doesn't show because you don't have all simple keys
the tram
take the bench from tram first
you have to sit on the bench
the bench!
glad i got you before you jumped down here
you can get a few of them
since they're not in the rando logic it seems they don't properly show if they're unreachable
only through mod
also, should probably drop that follow

you should definitely be able to finish this, only this and final boss areas left

just press your weapon hotkey to quick de-equip and just blast with ice
i dont think i ever finished this game because of losing progress on death after 20hours lol

the game was just slightly too long for me, i lost interest

make more money. Just make sure you have enough left for a portal
suck those primers
it is, but can probably make like 3k with those essences
skin the dragon LETSGO
the ice shotgun seems better damage wise?
it's 4 coin per essence, so 12 coins per cast. But enemies drop like 20-40 coins per cast
oh does it? kk guwuNoted
sadKEK
might be you choose either one for a reward
DIESOFCRINGE
You could say that is really UnEpic
ah yeah, that works
boss door right there KEKW
imytSGame
this is a bit dated KEKW
imytSlurp
that might be the best axe tbh
the one you already have
I'll check
This the best axe looks like. Excalibur and Bonebreaker are stronger base but not triple crit and some enemies are resistant to slash or bash.
Trae todos los hombres no sirve por si hacerlo con una pagla están esperando un sd2 chino cuesta 60 pavos ok
put a portal
you can, it's fine
yeah this looks familair
what happened?
pepeDeadge
HUH
I'm not sure if that's not a glitch or something
so was just looking at my file, i was lvl 13, only on hard difficulty
no hard++? pepeW
that no iframes kinda fun
it might be only in the area... like you teleport in the area and it thinks you're still in the lava when in that room, and never updates the state.
that's a gg
I mean, you do have the best axe. Boss door is right there SMILERS
the mace can hit multiple enemies at once. Excalibur has much more base damage
but the lack of triple crits sucks
use a scroll
I just arrived home after the metro card side quest
yeah, I just left it on the reception so they should give it to you when you arrive
you can get pretty far without falling
test it right here
Spittin
idk, I kinda like dumb mechanics

oh, was it an insane layover or something
can confirm
getting out of here is equally bad LOL
LOL maybe ill just fly over there and hang with u instead KEKW im in guadalajara rn
yeah unfort its yugioh season again which means inf planes
invi and phase door
buy phase door at least
do you have improve armor/weapon?
the spell should be stronger, since the scroll is basically a lv 0 alteration cast
that is how it works

might be a ladder behind
ok no idea

you don't need to do in order
just go straight to last window

top room to the right
bottom, to the right
then the one completely at bottom
skull bone bone
one completely at the top
back to bottom left of middle room
now save
KEKW
no
only one hit
what does your stats say for crit?
34% yeah... not bad
maybe excalibur averages higher, base damage is really high on it
put on latent life
don't think, it's to the left, gotta go around
you do, you make a profit. More stuff to buy next zone I think
yer loicense to pull excalibur
wait till you boost it with the spell
yeah, sure
it can still crit for... idk how much normal crits are
base damage on sword is 350
yeah armors resist slash
just go in and slap it pepeW
probably fine
that's a lotta crab
do you still have an heat aura scroll?
it should kill the crabs
yeah a lot of stuff is like that. Multiplayer maps are even worse, need some specific solutions a lot of the time
not offensive spells
try frostbreath?
it should cook both crabs in water and the big one
you can spam breath
it's area of effect and won't get interrupted
from bottom left in water
might be immune to frost tho since it shoots frost
wait you have the quest for pieces of shield? Since when?
don't remember at all about the key

great for you
well deserved break
aw
sorry I haven't been around much this week - been crazy busy
did you ever improve the silver armor?
oh you got a place?
studio?
oh man I'm out of the loop 😂
glad you found somewhere though. must be a big relief
tele to shop
it's right beside
it's ok focus on game
Competition between landlords is good for you.
looks intense haha
woah
you had latent life
this is interesting
put it back on
wow

Such an unnecessary headache, lol. Didn't you already talk to your current place?
fantastic
Love to hear that
sounds much better than studio living 🥰
Yeah, that's great.
awesome stuff

all good gtg myself
see you when you get back
have fun!
I'll be on the lookout!

oh :(
Bless you!
ah this room brings back memories
That, or leave it at one snake head, which is far more manageable than thise invulnerable ghosts
light pet doesn't kill ghosts?
I was doing dishes
kinda missed start of fights
imytJam
Won't say anything pepeW
Having not played, I do have an idea: are there any mirror shields/spells?
they break from damage, but are immune to poison
Those things seem op
The gaze kills it
I don't think bow is that strong from what I remember
but it's decent and not much time you're committed
the bow i have is kinda slow, but i know i had to go bow build to even try since i didnt use magic lol
so you can keep taking shots without being stuck for 3 seconds
I mean the bow, that's the advantage
just not necessarily strong otherwise
the acid bow was the highest damage one I think at 170 or 180
OMG
TOMORROWERINO
Wait, are those ghosts or ice things? If they're ice, do you still have heat aura?

Ghosts seem to spawn at half, not snake death
No, last time,  ghosts started spawning, you still had snakes out
I'm guessing hp threshold instead
does he ever go all the way down tho?
andyBless emrayBless kggBless samusBless srtBlessRNG
Ok, do you have anything that does fire or light?
*shrug*?
the claussen Cryge the whole universe.
probably fire if not light
NOOOO
his fire lasers seem to kill his own ghosts
You could get a few points in fire spells
Well, you don't know if he's weak to bows either
the game expected you to play on low difficulty first and only do hard later I think KEKW
you're really screwed without respecs
spacepigHi spacepigHi
Hmm I might be enjoying this a bit
I'm cheering - I like the challenge you're taking on
this is why i quit the game :)
That's the way I beat the game. By taking the game slow. But I don't mind fights that are more a careful marathon than fast reaction.
DIESOFCRINGE
He's cooked imytFade
catNodders
My suggestions are also coming from not playing the game, so I dunno if things are or arent possible
garden shop has heat aura
sewer has fireball
fireball in sewer is pretty good
fireball is not firebolt
it's a different kind of spell, fireball does fire clouds on impact
fireball can also hurt yourself if you're in the fire
I mean, if the ghosts only have 1 or 2 hp if you hit them with something they aren't immune to, you may only need a fire or light aoe
BRUUUUH
I doubt they're that weak
GAMBA take InternetBound's points GAMBA
WHAT
aight, pass me the controller pepeW
and did all the challenges
I'm fairly sure heat aura worked for ghosts, at least
samusNodderz
At least you got chat with you! imytMlady
our lizard brains dont have the patience for this boss fight
I basically only shot from top or bottom when eye laser was at other end. pepeW
it is slow
Man, the lack of respecs takes the fun out. Do you have infinite ones on lower difficulty?
no, but game is easy enough that it's not much of a problem
ice will
k gg
okay never much time

I am a winner for believing in imyt. Also all this fake cash, but mostly believing in imyt

just keep going for now
can always come back if you're lacking something for final boss or whatever
just so you know... if I ever have a son..  you're going to have to change your name because i'm stealing it.

hell yea, sounds dope
this guys CLIPPING
how many skill points you got left? Hmm
There's other solutions, pretty sure
but easiest one would need skill points
i bet the bow is the solution again
there's a few things he could do, but it's all complex and specific

you want to know?

kill one skele at a time and try and control it when necro respawn

you need sight the same way as targeting for arcane control

surely it can't get any worse

This game is so sick in the head that you can't shoot on the ground so the flying enemies don't even fly. They just go straight to the fucking ground and attack you. It's so stupid. I can't handle flying enemies that don't wanna fly because they know being on the ground is stronger. It actually makes me mad. They just go to my knees. You're a flying creature and you're deciding to stay on the ground because the game is horrible.

charles???
Yes, Charles is streaming for Imyt today.
This is a unique view of his CRT on the SM runs
^
The picture quality on this CRT is amazing what TV is it?
this is an Ikegami HTM 1980R
Cool
it's a PVM/BVM monitor
Oh that makes sense my CRT looks trash
It's just a TV and it's from 1988
yeah this one is pretty intense
it's a full RGB setup and such too
How does the super Nintendo interface with it?
Does it have a video or something?
Svideo
Even if it did, there would be very little reason - the RGB inputs are far higher quality
Charles has a very complicated setup
Mod for the SNES
RGB output, goes to a splitter, one part from splitter goes to capture, other goes through a couple of steps before it gets to the PVM.
If you're interested in the details, I recommend asking Charles on his channel so he can tell you verbally.
Check out @smCharles's stream! twitch.tv/smcharles They were last seen playing Super Metroid!
