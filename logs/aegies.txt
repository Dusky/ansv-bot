Its interesting to see Netflix is ending the TV broadcast of the longest running weekly Live show on TV
yep
@aegies did you play The Surge? or anyone else?
Surge was fun cutting of limbs for loots
surge one was good, didnt care much for 2
nor the soda
Surge was no Josta for sure
I couldnâ€™t get into Surge, but im also very particular on what my character looks like and the random limbs was ugly to me
iâ€™m drawn to the sci-fi settingâ€¦ but havenâ€™t been able to get into a 3rd person souls like combat game
the whole animation priority throws me off
what 3rd person souls like would you recommend for a noob to the genre? ðŸ˜… Elden Ring?
this one is bad
Elden ring is the best entry point imo
Elden ring for sure
or Dark Souls 1
So Elden Ring is the most friendly because you arent really stuck in a "kill the boss or never go to a new area" but Demons Souls is maybe the most directed?
This is about the point in the game where I bounced. Couldn't get into it which bummed me out
