# Login System Test Guide

## 🔐 Login System Features Implemented

### ✅ **Security Enhancements**
- **Open redirect protection**: Validates redirect URLs to prevent security issues
- **Enhanced logging**: Tracks login attempts, successes, and failures with IP addresses
- **Session security**: Stores additional metadata for audit trails
- **Input sanitization**: Prevents oversized password attacks

### ✅ **Design Integration**
- **Beta design system**: Login page now matches the beta UI styling perfectly
- **Dark/light theme**: Theme toggle with localStorage persistence
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-friendly login interface
- **Loading states**: Visual feedback during authentication
- **Auto-clearing errors**: Error messages fade after 5 seconds

### ✅ **User Experience**
- **Auto-focus**: Password field focused on page load
- **Enter key support**: Submit form with Enter key
- **Password visibility toggle**: Show/hide password functionality
- **Loading feedback**: Button shows spinner during submission
- **Smart redirects**: Remembers intended destination after login

### ✅ **Navigation Integration**
- **Logout button**: Added to beta navigation dropdown
- **User menu**: Combined theme selection and logout in user dropdown
- **Session awareness**: Automatically redirects authenticated users

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### 1. **Access Control Test**
1. Try to access `/beta` without authentication → Should redirect to `/login`
2. Try to access `/beta/stats` without authentication → Should redirect to `/login`
3. Try to access `/beta/settings` without authentication → Should redirect to `/login`

### 2. **Login Functionality Test**
1. Go to `/login`
2. Try empty password → Should show "Password is required" error
3. Try wrong password → Should show "Invalid admin password" error
4. Try correct password (default: `admin123`) → Should redirect to `/beta`

### 3. **Session Management Test**
1. Login successfully
2. Access beta pages → Should work without re-authentication
3. Click logout in navigation → Should redirect to login page
4. Try to access beta pages again → Should require re-authentication

### 4. **Theme Persistence Test**
1. On login page, toggle theme to dark
2. Login successfully
3. Theme should persist in beta interface
4. Logout and return → Theme should still be dark

### 5. **Security Test**
1. Login successfully
2. Try to access `/login?next=http://evil.com` → Should redirect to `/beta` (not evil.com)
3. Check server logs for login attempt tracking

## 📋 **Default Credentials**
- **Username**: (not required)
- **Password**: `admin123` (or check your `settings.conf` file)

- **Error handling**: Clear, user-friendly error messages
- **Loading states**: Visual feedback during all operations

## 🔒 **Security Notes**
- All beta routes now require authentication
- Session includes IP tracking for security auditing
- Failed login attempts are logged with timestamps
- Redirect validation prevents open redirect attacks
- Input validation prevents basic attacks

The login system is now fully functional and integrated with the beta interface!
